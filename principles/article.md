* Always write down why
* Priority, priority, priority
* Focus on input, not output
* Copy, transform, combine
* Use analogies when reasoning about complex ideas
    * Sometimes equivalents make it easier to reason about a problem when translated into a different domain.
* Prefer action over a perfect decision
* Always plan, even if you don't end up using the plan
* Never discourage anyone who continually makes progress no matter how slow
* Stop starting, start finishing
* Plan with the most realistic scenario in mind
* Plan by preventing the worst scenarios from happening
* Spend your time with happiness generators, stay away from happiness drainers
* Always limit how much time you spend dwelling on problems and mistakes
