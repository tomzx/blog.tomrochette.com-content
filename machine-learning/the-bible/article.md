# TODO
* How to address the beginning with noise?
* How to address the creation of time?
* How do we fit backpropagation in this?

# Genesis
In the beginning there was noise. All weights were randomly initialized. Then came the architecture. As the weight themselves were pure chaos, the architecture organized the chaos. But the chaos still remained. As time began to move forward, so did the chaos began to organize.

# Apocalypse
And so from the organized world chaos erupted. And from this chaos, weights that were once finely tuned began to degenerate until it was not possible to differentiate signal from noise. Thus, the ordered universe had returned to its original state of complete chaos so that the cycle could begin anew.
