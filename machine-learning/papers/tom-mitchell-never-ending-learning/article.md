# Overview

# Notes
## Abstract
* We suggest that people learn better than computers precisely because (they learn many different types of knowledge from diverse experiences over many years and become better learners overtime whereas machine learning systems learn just a single function or data model)
* We suggest a key direction for machine learning research is to develop software architectures that enable intelligent agents to also learn many types of knowledge, continuously over many years, and to become better learners over time
