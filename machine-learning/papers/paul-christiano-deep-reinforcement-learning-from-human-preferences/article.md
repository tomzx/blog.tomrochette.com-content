## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Human evaluators are provided short video clips (trajectory segments) where they have to rate two clips against each other
* The RL agent is given information as to which trajectory segments are preferred other other trajectory segments
	* This allows it to try and determine which state/action are better than others given the human feedback

# Notes
## 1 Introduction
* In order to practically train deep RL systems with human feedback, we need to decrease the amount of feedback required by several orders of magnitude
* Our approach is to learn a reward function from human feedback and then to optimize that reward function
* We desire a solution to sequential decision problems without a well-specified reward function that
	* enables us to solve tasks for which we can only recognize the desired behavior, but not necessarily demonstrate it
	* allows agents to be taught by non-expert users
	* scales to large problems
	* is economical with user feedback

## 1.1 Related Work
* Our work could also be seen as a specific instance of the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning framework
* This framework considers a two-player game between a human and a robot interacting with an environment with the purpose of maximizing the human's reward function
* In our setting the human is only allowed to interact with this game by stating their preferences
* Our key contribution is to scale human feedback up to deep reinforcement learning and to learn much more complex behaviors

## 2 Preliminaries and Method
### 2.1 Setting and Goal
* Instead of assuming that the environment produces a reward signal, we assume that there is a human overseer who can express preferences between trajectory segments
* A trajectory segment is a sequence of observations and actions, $\sigma = ((o_0, a_0), (o_1, a_1), \dots, (o_{k-1}, a_{k-1})) \in (\mathcal{0} \times \mathcal{A})^k$
* $\sigma^1 \succ \sigma^2$ indicates that the human prefers trajectory segment $\sigma^1$ over trajectory segment $\sigma^2$
* Informally, the goal of the agent is to produce trajectories which are preferred by the human, while making as few queries as possible to the human
* We will evaluate our algorithms' behavior in two way:
	* Quantitative: We say that preference $\succ$ are generated by a reward function $r: \mathcal{0} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
$$
((o_0^1, a_0^1), \dots, (o_{k-1}^1, a_{k-1}^1)) \succ ((o_0^2, a_0^2), \dots, (o_{k-1}^2, a_{k-1}^2))
$$
whenever
$$
r(o_0^1, a_0^1) + \dots + r(o_{k-1}^1, a_{k-1}^1) > r(o_0^2, a_0^2) + \dots + r(o_{k-1}^2, a_{k-1}^2)
$$
	* Qualitative: Qualitatively evaluate how well the agent satisfies the human's preferences

### 2.2 Our Method
#### 2.2.2 Preference Elicitation
* The human overseer is given a visualization of two trajectory segments, in the form of short movie clips
* The human then indicates which segment they prefer, that the two segments are equally good (or bad?), or that they are unable to compare the two segments
* The human judgments are recorded in a database $\mathcal{D}$ of triples $(\sigma^1, \sigma^2, \mu)$, where $\sigma^1$ and $\sigma^2$ are the two segments and $\mu$ is a distribution over {1, 2} indicating which segment the user preferred
	* If the human selects one segment as preferable, then $\mu$ puts all of its mass on that choice
	* If the human marks the segments as equally preferable, then $\mu$ is uniform
	* If the human marks the segments as incomparable, then the comparison is not included in the database

## 3 Experimental Results
### 3.3 Ablation Studies
* In general we discovered that asking humans to compare longer clips was significantly more helpful per clip, and significantly less helpful per frame
* We found that for short clips it took human rates a while just to understand the situation, while for longer clips the evaluation time was a roughly linear function of the clip length
* We tried to choose the shortest clip length for which the evaluation time was linear
