## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Given a training set $D$ of size $n$, bagging generates $m$ new training sets $D_i$, each of size $n'$, by sampling from $D$ uniformly and with replacement (the same sample may be present multiple times)
* The $m$ models are fitted using the $m$ bootstrap samples and combined by averaging the output (for regression) or voting (for classification)

# Notes
* Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) can push a good but unstable procedure a significant step towards optimality
* On the other hand, it can slightly degrade the performance of stable procedures
