# Notes
## 3 Predictron Architecture
* The predictron is composed of four main components
	* A state representation $\textbf{s} = f(s)$ that encodes raw input $s$
	* A model $\textbf{s}'$, $\textbf{r}$, $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = m(\textbf{s}, \beta)$ that maps from internal state $\textbf{s}$ to subsequent internal state $\textbf{s}'$, internal reward $\textbf{r}$, and internal discount $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$
	* A value function $v$ that outputs internal values $\textbf{v} = v(\textbf{s})$ representing the future, internal return from internal state $\textbf{s}$ onwards
	* An accumulator, which combines together internal rewards, discounts, and values, into an overall estimate of value $\textbf{g}$
