## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Data: The units of data from which information/knowledge will be extracted
* Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline: A set of tools/procedure to convert the data into a format more appropriate for further processing, as well as storing
* Model/Architecture: The machine learning model that converts incoming data into predictions/decisions
* API: HTTP endpoint that can be easily called to pass information to the system or query the model for information
	* Request data from data source
	* Run inference given data
* Benchmark: Test changes to your model to see how they fare against previous models
* Containers: Encapsulates the tools and procedures used to process data and turn it into information. The container makes it easy to install dependencies and to reproduce the environment on other machines
