* Read `package.json` to discover what packages VS Code depends on
* Observe the root directory structure, and more specifically the `extensions` and `src` directories which contain the bulk of the source code
	* A lot of the code in the `extensions` directory appears to be dedicated to programming language support
		* The remainder of the extensions seem to provide functionality for things that aren't "core" to vscode, such as `configuration-editing`, `emmet`, `extension-editing` and some color themes
* If you look at the `.vscode/launch.json`, you will find all the tasks that can be executed from within VS Code debugger. One task of interest is `Launch VS Code` which will take care of launching VS Code for us so that we may debug it
	* In this file you will also discover that it runs `${workspaceFolder}/scripts/code.bat`, which is the next script we'll take a look at
* In `./scripts/code.bat`, we discover that this script will run `yarn` if the `node_modules` directory is missing, download the electron binaries if necessary and call `gulp compile` if the `out` directory is missing, then finally start the electron/vs code binary in the `.build/electron` directory
* We then start to look for common entry points file such as `index.ts/js` or  `main.ts/js`, for which we find a match in the `src` directory
* We take a quick look around, trying to find where electron is likely to be instantiated... There's a lot of code in `src/main.js` that would be better elsewhere to make it easier to navigate this file
* Close to the bottom of the file we discover the code we are interested in as a call to `app.once('ready', ...)`
	* Once the app is ready, we want to call `src/bootstrap-amd` and pass `vs/code/electron-main/main` as our entry point (per the signature of the exported function in `./src/bootstrap-amd`)
		* Here we can go to two places, either `src/bootstrap-amd` or `src/vs/code/electron-main/main`
			* We take a quick peek at both files and we can quickly tell that `src/bootstrap-amd` is used mainly to load `src/vs/code/electron-main/main` which is the file we're going to be interested in
* Once again, we quickly look around `src/vs/code/electron-main/main` and find that the main logic is at the bottom of the file
* First the command line arguments are parsed
* Then services are bootstrapped/instantiated
* Finally the `CodeApplication` is started up
* This leads us to look into `src/vs/code/electron-main/app.ts`
* As the file is quite large, we start by skimming through it, looking at the available methods on the `CodeApplication` class as well as its properties
* Looking at the constructor, we can see that a lot of objects are given to it. We also observe the use of the @... syntax (those are decorators)
	* In this case (and for most constructors), this is how VS Code does service (dependencies) injection
* One will also notice that most, if not all parameters have a visibility assigned to it. What this does is that it will create an associated property in the class as well as assigning the parameter value to this property in the constructor. Thus, instead of writing
<pre><code class="language-typescript line-numbers">
class AnotherClass {
	private someClass: SomeClass;

	constructor(someClass: SomeClass) {
		this.someClass = someClass;
	}
}
</code></pre>
you simply write
<pre><code class="language-typescript line-numbers">
class AnotherClass {
	constructor(private someClass: SomeClass) {
	}
}
</code></pre>


## Notes
* If you start VS Code using the debug feature, you will not be able to open the Chrome DevTools (at this moment, 2018-05-26) because only 1 process is allowed to attach to the Chrome DevTools instance, and that process is the VS Code editor that started the debugged VS Code instance
