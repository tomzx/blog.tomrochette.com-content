## Context
Checklists are a highly effective way to make sure that critical elements of a routine are done. As such, I want to explore and make checklists for different things that are important in my life.

# Life
* [ ] Did I eat 3 meals today?
* [ ] Are time-based events scheduled in the calendar?
* [ ] Are repetitive events scheduled in the calendar?

# Software development
* [ ] Is the feature implementing all the desired use cases?
* [ ] Are tests written to cover the common case and some edge cases?
* [ ] Are tests passing?

# Machine learning
* [ ] Is there a row of data even when the value is 0?
