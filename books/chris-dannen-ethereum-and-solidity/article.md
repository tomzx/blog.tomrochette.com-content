# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Bridging the Blockchain Knowledge Gap
### What Ethereum Does
* In Ethereum, smart contracts are written in the programming language Solidity

### Three Parts of a Blockchain
* A blockchain can be thought of as a database that is distributed, or duplicated, across many computers
* The innovation represented by the word blockchain is the specific ability of this network database to reconcile the order of transactions, even when a few nodes on the network receive transactions in various order
* What is widely called a blockchain is really the combination of three technologies
	* Peer-to-peer networking
	* Asymmetric cryptography: In Bitcoin and Ethereum, asymmetric cryptography is used to create a set of credentials for your account, to ensure that only you can transfer your tokens
	* Cryptographic hashing
