## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Quotes
* People who feel good about themselves produce good results
* Help people reach their full potential, catch them doing something right

# Notes
## The Search
* Effective managers manage themselves and the people they work with so that both the organization and the people profit from their presence

## The One Minute Manager
* People who feel good about themselves produce good results
	* Helping people to feel good about themselves is a key to getting more done
* Productivity is more than just the quantity of work done. It is also the quality
	* Quality is simply giving people the product or service they really want and need
* Do not make decisions for others

## The First Secret: One Minute Goals
* Once told what needs to be done, each goal is recorded on no more than a single page
* One of your goals for the future is for you to identify and solve your own problems
* Tell me what your problem is, but put it in behavioral terms (observable, measurable terms)
* Describe what you would like to be happening in behavioral terms
* If you can't tell what you'd like to be happening, you don't have a problem yet. You're just complaining
	* A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening
* Talk about what may have caused the discrepancy between the actual and the desired
* You're good... Remember that next time you have a problem

## One Minute Goals: Summary
* Agree on your goals
* See what good behavior looks like
* Write out each of your goals on a single sheet of paper using less than 250 words
* Read and re-read each goal, which requires only a minute or so each time you do it
* Take a minute every once in a while out of your day to look at your performance
* See whether or not your behavior matches your goal

## The Second Secret: One Minute Praisings
* It is a lot easier to do things well if you get crystal-clear feedback on how you do things
* Let others know in no uncertain terms when they are doing well, and when they are doing poorly
* Help people reach their full potential, catch them doing something right
* Put the accent on the positive
* Give praise as soon as something right is done
* Specify why
* Do it consistently

## One Minute Praisings: Summary
* Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing
* Praise people immediately
* Tell people what they did right - be specific
* Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps the organization and the other people who work there
* Stop for a moment of silence to let them "feel" how good you feel
* Encourage them to do more of the same
* Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization

## The Third Secret: One Minute Reprimands
* As soon as the mistake is known, go see the person. Confirm the facts. Tell precisely what was done wrong (the behavior). Share how you feel about it

## One Minute Reprimands: Summary
* Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms
* The first half of the reprimand
	* Reprimand people immediately
	* Tell people what they did wrong - be specific
	* Tell people how you feel about what they did wrong - and in no uncertain terms
	* Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel
* The second half of the reprimand
	* Shake hands, or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side
	* Remind them how much you value them
	* Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation
	* Realize that when the reprimand is over, it's over
