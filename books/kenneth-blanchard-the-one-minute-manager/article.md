## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Notes
## The Search
* Effective managers manage themselves and the people they work with so that both the organization and the people profit from their presence

## The One Minute Manager
* People who feel good about themselves produce good results
	* Helping people to feel good about themselves is a key to getting more done
* Productivity is more than just the quantity of work done. It is also the quality
	* Quality is simply giving people the product or service they really want and need
* Do not make decisions for others

## The First Secret: One Minute Goals
* Once told what needs to be done, each goal is recorded on no more than a single page
* One of your goals for the future is for you to identify and solve your own problems
* Tell me what your problem is, but put it in behavioral terms (observable, measurable terms)
* Describe what you would like to be happening in behavioral terms
* If you can't tell what you'd like to be happening, you don't have a problem yet. You're just complaining
	* A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening
