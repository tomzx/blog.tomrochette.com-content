All articles on this blog originate from my head. The content of the articles is mostly mine but some articles are in part or completely written by AI/LLMs. Those articles will be tagged accordingly: no tag for completely original content, [`partially-ai-generated`](/tag:partially-ai-generated) for articles with one or many AI generated sentences, and [`fully-ai-generated`](/tag:fully-ai-generated) when all the content is AI generated.

I use a variety of LLM providers (in order of frequency of use):
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
* [Poe](https://poe.com/)
* [Meta.ai](https://www.meta.ai/)
* [Reka.ai](https://chat.reka.ai/)
