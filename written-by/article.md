All articles on this blog originate from my mind.
Most articles are written by me, but some are partially or entirely AI/LLMsâ€‘generated.

Those articles will be tagged accordingly:
* No tag for completely original content.
* [`partially-ai-generated`](/tag:partially-ai-generated) for articles with one or many AI-generated sentences or with some feedback provided by AI.
  This covers articles where there is 1 word changed by AI to the article being almost entirely written by AI but with some human input.
* [`fully-ai-generated`](/tag:fully-ai-generated) when all the content is AI-generated.
  This covers articles that are entirely written by AI without any human input (except for possibly removing sentences).

I also use additional tags in relation to AI usage, namely:
* [`ai-feedback`](/tag:ai-feedback) for articles that were edited following AI feedback.

I tag the articles with the LLMs that were involved.
Look for tags starting with `llm=`.

I use a variety of LLM providers (in order of frequency of use):
* [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [Groq](https://chat.groq.com/)
* [Poe](https://poe.com/)
