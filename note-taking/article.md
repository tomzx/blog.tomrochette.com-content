## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* What is the read vs write of notes?
* What should be an ideal read/write ratio?

# Overview

# Notes

* date/time
* tags

* Use a concept similar to the hierarchical approach used for memory in computers (register, cache, ram, disk)
* Write short-lived ideas and thoughts in a buffer file
* Promote interesting ideas into a journal file (from buffer to journal)

> I found the success rate of finding something there vs google was quite low and things quickly became obsolete
>  If I re-google something vs read a note i wrote down 3 years ago i might hit an article teaching me a new better way to do something instead of being stuck in my old bubble.
