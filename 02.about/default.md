Hi,

My name is Tom Rochette and this is a short presentation about myself.

I was born in Montreal. I'm a hard worker, interested in artificial intelligence, technology, science, personal development, and any logical or irrational topics. I'm working hard on improving my skills.

I'm now a bachelor in Software Engineering, degree which I've completed at the École Polytechnique de Montréal in 2011. Since then, I've been working to perfect and broaden my skills.

In June 2015 I decided I'd dedicate a good part of my life on the topic of artificial general intelligence, to understand what intelligence is and how it can be replicated in machines.

When I'm online, I like to spend my time working on different projects of mine. Most are programming related. Otherwise, I read articles about software engineering practices, look for new ways to improve my workflow or I answer questions I've been asking myself. I also enjoy answering questions others have.
