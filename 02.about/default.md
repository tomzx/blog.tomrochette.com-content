Hi,

I'm Tom and this is a short presentation about myself.

I was born in Montreal. I'm a hard worker, interested in [artificial (general) intelligence](../agi/README.md), [machine learning](../machine-learning/README.md) technology, science, personal development, and any logical or irrational topics. I'm working hard on improving my skills.

I'm a bachelor in Software Engineering, degree which I've completed at the [École Polytechnique de Montréal](https://polymtl.ca/) in 2011. Since then, I've been working to perfect and broaden my skills.

In June 2015 I decided I'd dedicate a good part of my life on the topic of artificial general intelligence, to understand what intelligence is and how it can be replicated in machines.

When I'm online, I like to spend my time working on different projects of mine. Most are programming related. Otherwise, I read articles about software engineering practices, look for new ways to improve my workflow or I answer questions I've been asking myself. I also enjoy answering questions others have.
