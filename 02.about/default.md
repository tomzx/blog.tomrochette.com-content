Hello, I'm Tom!

This is a brief introduction about myself.

I was born in Montreal.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering which I completed at the [École Polytechnique de Montréal](https://polymtl.ca/) in 2011.

In June 2015 I decided to dedicate a significant portion of my career to the topic of artificial general intelligence, to understand what intelligence is and how it can be replicated in machines.

I'm interested in [artificial (general) intelligence](../agi/README.md), [machine learning](../machine-learning/README.md) technology, science, and personal development.
I enjoy reading articles about software engineering practices, looking for new ways to improve my workflows, and [answering questions](../questions/article.md) I've been asking myself.
