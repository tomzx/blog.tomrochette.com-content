# Why tabs are kept open
* Want to read but
	* Too long -> Transfer to pocket
* Want to watch but
	* Too long -> Add to a youtube watchlist (which I'll never watch)
* I need them open to quickly enter data
* I want to watch them again and again
	* Download with youtube-dl and watch using VLC
* Would maybe read one day, but definitely not now (very low priority)
	* Transfer to pocket

# Rules
* If a tab is scanned more than 5/10 times, it goes into the backlog bin
