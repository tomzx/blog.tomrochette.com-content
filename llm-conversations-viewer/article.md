I built something I've wanted for a while within an hour.
It's a LLM conversations viewer, available for everyone to use at [https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer](https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer).
You can use it to view conversations exported from various LLM platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in a nice interface.
It can also be used to share conversations with others so that they can view them, using https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer/?url=url-to-json-or-zip (such as a raw Gist URL).
