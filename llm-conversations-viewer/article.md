I built something I've wanted for a while within an hour using Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5).
It's a LLM conversations viewer, available for everyone to use at [https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer](https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer).
It is a single page application, 100% client-side.
You can use it to view conversations exported from various LLM platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in a nice interface.
It can also be used to share conversations with others so that they can view them, using https://tomzxcode.github.io/llm-conversations-viewer/?url=url-to-json-or-zip (such as a raw Gist URL).
It can be useful if you use many platforms through their clients (web or mobile) and would like to be able to search those conversations in one place.
Play with it and let me know what you think!
