## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How can one track progress? Is there progress without explicitly specified goals?

# Overview
* Dump everything in my brain in text documents
* Schedule things that need to be scheduled/reminded
	* Decompose tasks and define time/effort estimate

# Currently
* Write everything down in markdown documents
* Write thoughts in Google Keep while on the move, then merge them in existing documents
* Attempt to manually aggregate content

## Missing
* No time tracking/evolution of articles
* Manual aggregation is difficult and time consuming
* Most of what is written is never reviewed and potentially forgotten
	* Content is not consumed/reused
	* Most of the time, the point is to make explicit what is in the brain, so that it can also be referred to later on in a reliable format
* Notes I leave myself aren't tagged

## Should Do
* Get feedback on what I wrote that is consumable by others
