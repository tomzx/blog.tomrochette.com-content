* Do you understand what is at stake?
* Do you know what already exists?
* Can you take an informed decision?
* What did you consider during your decision?
* What are your unknowns (things you'd need to know before your can make a decision)?
* Do you have experience with the problem which needs a decision?

* Indicate who has the most expertise to make the decision.

* You should be allowed to cast a vote if the decision will impact you. If it doesn't (i.e., you're not a stakeholder), your vote will not be counted towards  any option.
