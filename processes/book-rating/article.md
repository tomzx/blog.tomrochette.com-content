In this article I define a 1-5 rating scale for books in order to be consistent across my evaluations. Given that rating books is somewhat subjective, introducing some amount of standardization on how I rate them should help with [managing my reading](../managing-your-reading/article.md).

Format of presentation:

Score (from 1 to 5) Representative emoji
* Satisfaction
* Words expressing the level of satisfaction
* Strength of recommendation

1 🤮
* unsatisfactory
* very bad, horrible, boring, repetitive, disagreeable to read, waste of time, can't force myself to read
* strongly not recommended

2 ☹️
* unsatisfactory
* bad
* not recommended

3 😐
* satisfactory
* neutral
* might want to read

4 ☺️
* satisfactory
* good
* recommended

5 😍
* satisfactory
* very good, great, amazing, exciting, intriguing, fascinating, full of new knowledge, can't stop reading
* strongly recommended
