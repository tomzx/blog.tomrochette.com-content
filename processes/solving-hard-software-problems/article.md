* For problems related to environment setup, trying to accomplish the same thing on two computers can help identify disparities caused by the environment and not the code itself.
* If you are blocked when trying to solve your problem, define timebox how long you will continue attempting to address the problem before changing your approach.
    * Every half-hour/hour ask yourself "Have I made progress in the last period?" If the answer is no, define a time limit before reassessing your next steps
