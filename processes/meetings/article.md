## Before
* Write/prepare an agenda listing the items to be discussed
* Indicate the duration and responsible/lead of each
	* Aim for a meeting to last under an hour. If more time appears to be required, then prior work should be done in order to reduce the amount of time necessary for the meeting.
* Define the list of invitees, try to keep it short, possibly under 6 people
* Share the agenda with all the attendees
* Schedule the meeting around boundaries (beginning/end of day, before/after lunch)

## During
* Present the agenda
* Designate a person that will make sure that the agenda is respected

## At the end
* Determine next actions
* Define deadlines for each next action
* Assign a responsible for each next action

## After the meeting
* Create tasks in a task tracking system for the next actions

## Recurrent meetings
* In the case where a recurrent meeting needs to be scheduled at a different time than usual, specify in the body of the message the reason of the change.
