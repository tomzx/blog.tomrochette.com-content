The process described below attempts to optimize reading quality books and enjoying the reading experience. As such, it promotes book exploration (discovery of new books) and reading books which have a high rating according to your own taste. Books which receive lower ratings (compared to other books) are moved down the reading priority list and will not be read until books that have higher priority (i.e., rating) either are finished reading or their rating decreases such that other books are now high priority.

* Pick highly read books (use a site like goodreads to identify those books)
* When reading a book, record the page you start and stop reading on, the time you start and stop reading and emit a rating for what you've read
	* You can decide to optimize whether you want to optimize per page rating or per duration rating, that is, get the most value per page or by time spent reading
* Add new books to your reading list regularly. Those books are considered as having the highest priority and are then added to the prioritized list of books according to its rating
* When not reading a new book, read the books in order of priority and by interest at the time of reading
