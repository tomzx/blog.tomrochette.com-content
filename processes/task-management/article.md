Step to create a task
* Give it a title
* Give it at least one label
* Give it an assignee
* Decide if it's important or not
* Decide if it's urgent or not
* Give a rough estimate of effort
* Give a description if necessary
* Set a deadline if possible
* Set status to Unprioritized

During a workday
* Go through the tasks in the Do section, then the Decide section, then Delegate

Use Eisenhower matrix to determine task importance/urgency
Tasks that are not important/not urgent are moved to the backlog
Tasks that are not important/urgent are delegated to someone else
Tasks that are important/not urgent should be scheduled
Tasks that are important/urgent should be done ASAP

Unprioritized tasks should be queued, given their priority compared to already queued tasks
You should attempt to keep the unprioritized tasks count to 0
A task that is queued should have a deadline date
