* Decide what habit you want to have and record why you want this habit
* Start with the smallest amount of effort possible
* Increase the amount of effort regularly until you reach the desired amount of regular effort
* Track your habit in a habit recording system such as [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits)
* Review on a regular basis (monthly) whether you want to keep this habit or not
	* If you decide not to keep the habit, record why you decided to drop the habit such that if you decide to pick it up again, you can determine whether you might end up dropping it again.
