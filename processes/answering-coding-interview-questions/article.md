* Read the problem statement
* Look at any provided unit tests
* Add any unit tests you think might be relevant and not currently covered
* Order the unit tests from easiest to hardest
* Ask questions to confirm your understanding of the problem and verify edge cases
* Think of a possible approach to solve the problem
* Share your approach with the interviewers and get their buy-in
	* You may do this by writing pseudo-code as you are explaining your thought process
* Implement your solution
	* If you encounter any difficulties, state them and explain what you are thinking
	* Make use of preconditions/early exit if possible to handle empty cases
* Run your code frequently, even if it is not fully working
* Discuss any follow-up questions with the interviewers
