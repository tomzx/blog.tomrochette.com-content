* Define and agree on the purpose of the one on one
* Define the topics to be discussed prior to meeting
* Track and update metrics that you care about every time you meet
  * e.g., Predictability, Ownership, Purpose, Progress, Belonging
* Discuss the status of those metrics if necessary
* Write in a shared document (between the two of you) what is discussed
* If any action items are defined during those meetings, use a task tracking system to keep each other accountable
  * Always define a deadline on tasks to indicate when the task should be revisited
