* Define the topics to be discussed prior to meeting
* Track and update metrics that you care about every time you meet
  * e.g., Predictability, Ownership, Purpose, Progress, Belonging
* Discuss the status of those metrics if necessary
* Keep what is discussed in writing
* If any action items are defined at the end of those meetings, use a task tracking system to keep each other accountable
