* It's difficult to remember/know the current state of a project
	* Keep notes of the work that has been done, what is left to do
		* Create a to do list first, then proceed from that to do list
		* Update the to do list as you notice things that should be/not be done

# Process
* Determine what was worked on last time
* Determine what needs to be worked on now (priorities)
* Establish the current state of the project
	* Look at the state of tasks in the issues tracker
	* Ask others about the status of the project
