If you're having trouble with your DVD not being detected in Windows XP while being detected in the BIOS, this is THE solution you've been looking for.

This problem is generally caused by the Adaptec ASPI drivers needing to be updated. The best way to fix this problem is to download the latest Adaptec aspi_471a2 drivers. You can download them at [Softpedia.com][1].

Good luck!
