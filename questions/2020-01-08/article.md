# Question
Why do we think that an AGI will be able to become superior to what a society/company is able to accomplish by grouping individuals in order to accomplish a common goal?

# Answer
An AGI may be a strong single minded entity. Unlike societies and companies that are composed of numerous individuals with different values/beliefs/opinions, an AGI is expected to have a single set of clear, concise and non-contradicting values/beliefs/opinions. Given that an AGI should be able to explore all potential alternatives, it should be able to reason about all the potential sets of values/beliefs/opinions in order to determine the most coherent and appropriate one to hold. Meanwhile, we as human hold values/beliefs/opinions that are inconsistent with themselves or conflict between individuals.

In the human's case, our biggest issue is that we are competitive by nature. People will fight over resource if those are limited. Fighting will lead to winners and losers. The winners may not be necessarily the individuals with the "best" set of values/beliefs/opinions. This does not appear to produce ideal paths to desired goals.
