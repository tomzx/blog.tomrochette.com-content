# Question
Why do we think that an AGI will superior to what a society/company is able to accomplish by grouping individuals in order to accomplish a common goal?

# Answer
An AGI may be a strong single minded entity. Unlike societies and companies that are composed of numerous individuals with different values/beliefs/opinions (VBO), an AGI is expected to have a single set of clear, concise and non-contradicting VBO. An AGI should be able to explore all potential alternatives and reason about all the potential sets of VBO in order to determine the most coherent and appropriate set to hold. Meanwhile, we as humans hold VBO that are inconsistent. As a group, we are heterogenous in our VBO which means that conflict will arise since not all VBO can be the VBO of the group.

In the human's case, our biggest issue is that we are competitive by nature. People will fight over resource if those are limited. Fighting will lead to winners and losers. The winners may not be necessarily the individuals with the "best" set of VBO, which does not appear to produce ideal paths to desired goals.
