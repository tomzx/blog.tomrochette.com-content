# Question
Why do we think that an AGI will be able to become superior to what a society/company is able to accomplish by grouping individuals in order to accomplish a common goal?

# Answer
The main reason is that we think an AGI will be a strong single minded entity. Unlike societies and companies that are composed of numerous individuals with different values and opinions, an AGI is expected to have a single set of clear, concise and non-contradicting values, beliefs and opinions. Given that an AGI should be able to explore all potential alternatives, it should be able to reason about all the potential sets of values/beliefs/opinions in order to determine the most appropriate one to hold.
