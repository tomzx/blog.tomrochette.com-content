# Question
How can I organize all the webpages I never read?

# Answer
The following method should probably apply for content online as well as offline (magazine article, books).

The first, most important, and difficult strategy, is to simply let go of those articles. Most of the time, we keep certain things out of fear of missing out. We may also think that if at some point we have free time we'll go through them, however that never happens. We always try to find something new instead. This can either be seen as a way for the mind to communicate that it doesn't think it would be worthwhile to spend its time reading this content so it's better not to (lack of interest), or it's a problem of not being able to summon the necessary energy (lack of )
