# Question
How can one identify the areas he needs to improve?

# Answer
Through introspection.

As we do things through our daily lives, there are events which we wished had unfolded better. As we realize those areas of weaknesses, it is important to write them down so that we can build a list of those areas we may want to spend time improving in the future.

Another way one can identify the areas he needs to improve is to use the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/).
