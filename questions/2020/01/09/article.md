# Question
Is there a general characteristic of simple programs that are able to learn complex behaviors, such as neural network or RL-based algorithms that can be implemented in less than 100-250 lines?

# Answer
This question has come after thinking about DNA as being the code of a human being. DNA is also part of other animals, even viruses. Organisms use nucleotides to store the programs that are necessary to their existence. This code has evolved since we were non-biological. This likely means that from a large amount of randomness (chemical elements), nucleotides were formed, which then somehow led to the formation of DNA itself after a likely long process. If by randomness we moved from a chaotic world to one with order and structure, and where a chain of DNA could finally emerge, it would be interesting to investigate the process in further details to determine whether it could give us clues regarding the process of creating a program that could evolve the same way DNA did.

[Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) are also interesting to study in that aspect. By defining a small set of rules, it is possible to generate and observe complex behaviors.
