# Question
Is there a general characteristic of simple programs that are able to learn complex behaviors, such as neural network or RL-based algorithms that can be implemented in less than 100-250 lines?

# Answer
This question has come after thinking about DNA as being the code of a human being. DNA is also part of other animals, even viruses. Organisms use nucleic acids to store the programs that are necessary to their existence.
