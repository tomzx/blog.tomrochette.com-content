# Question
Is there a general characteristic of simple programs that are able to learn complex behaviors, such as neural network or RL-based algorithms that can be implemented in less than 100-250 lines?

# Answer
This question has come after thinking about DNA as being the code of a human being. DNA is also part of other animals, even viruses. Organisms use nucleic acids to store the programs that are necessary to their existence. This code has evolved since we were non-biological. This likely means that from a large amount of randomness, nucleic acids were formed, which then somehow led to the formation of
