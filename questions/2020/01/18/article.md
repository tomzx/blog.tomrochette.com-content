# Question
What is learning according to machine learning?

# Answer
It is the process (for supervised learning) of looking at numerous samples, decomposed into input variables and their associated target values and deriving, according to an algorithm, how to predict the target values given input variables. It is the process of compressing (in a potentially lossy way) the samples provided.

A pre-trained model generally cannot offer any prediction if asked. In some cases it may simply provide a random value. This is similar to a human being asked to answer a question about a topic for which they haven't read the book yet. If asked, they will simply say "I don't know" or will attempt to provide some answer.

One of the benefits of machine learning is that it is possible to define an error metric which can then be used
