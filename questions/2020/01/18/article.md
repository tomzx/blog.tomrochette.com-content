# Question
What is learning according to machine learning?

# Answer
It is (for supervised learning) looking at numerous samples, decomposing them into input variables and their associated target variables, and deriving according to an algorithm how to predict the target variables given input variables.

It is (potentially lossy) compression the observed samples.

It is the creation of some "memory" of the observed samples.
