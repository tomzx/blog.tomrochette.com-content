# Question
Is there value in writing everything down?

# Answer
This question came to be


* Most of what is written is never reviewed and potentially forgotten
	* Content is not consumed/reused
	* Most of the time, the point is to make explicit what is in the brain, so that it can also be referred to later on in a reliable format
* Write down everything as nothing stays on your mind forever
