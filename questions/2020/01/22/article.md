# Question
What can cause us to learn inefficiently?

# Answer
There are many reasons which can cause someone to learn at a slower pace than what should be possible. This can be caused by many factors, amongst them:

* Learning the same material under different wording
* Learning outdated material
* Learning incorrect material
* Learning from a source that makes the material difficult to understand
* Learning material for which we do not know the pre-requisites
* Learning from multiple sources with contradictory information
* Learning while not being completely focused on the task
* Learning without making the effort to recall what was learned

What is important to do while learning is to recognize when certain behaviors or circumstances make learning less efficient than desired.
