# Question
Should I solve my problem with AI?

# Answer
In this day and age, we want to make AI solve any kind of problems, even those that don't require AI.

When you build a product, you generally have a problem you are trying to solve. With AI, companies are looking at existing problems and trying to find ways to turn them into AI problems. It is not a problem in itself to attempt the exercise, but it is a mistake to implement an AI solution where a non-AI solution would've been more than adequate. There are still a lot of work that needs to be done in the field of automation that does not require AI, but simpler statistical approaches.
