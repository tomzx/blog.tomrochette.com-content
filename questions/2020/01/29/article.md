# Question
Is programmer commentary something that can provide value?

# Answer
A few years ago I was learning how to drive. One of the techniques they teach in order to learn the basics of driving and help you reduce the amount of stress related to driving is to comment on what you are doing: I'm looking at this panel that says the maximum speed is 50 km/h, I am watching in my mirror, I am signaling that I want to move to the right lane, I'm checking my right dead angle, etc. The use of this technique is that it makes what you are doing in your head explicit by saying it out loud.
