# Question
Given a continuously growing number of questions one ask himself, what is the proper procedure to use to answer these questions?

# Answer
There is no proper procedure per se. The best approach is simply to get started.

A lot of what I wrote in [How do you prioritize things when there are so many of them competing against one another?](../04) and [How can I organize all the webpages I never read?](../07) applies here, namely:

* Do not spend time answering questions you don't care about the answer
