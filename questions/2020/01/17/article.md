# Question
How does one determine the best material to learn a topic?

# Answer
My approach has always been based on the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd).

If I want to read a book on a given topic, I will first look for the books that are available and create a list. From that list I will then look at websites like GoodRead
