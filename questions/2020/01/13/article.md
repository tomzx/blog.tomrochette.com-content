# Question
What do humans modeled as computers look like?

# Answer
* Numerous processes all running in parallel in different regions of the body and the brain (heartbeat, breathing, sight, smell, taste).
* The brain runs multiple processes at once, each processing a different modal input (sight, taste, touch, hearing, smell).
* Those processes are buffered and a process takes care of synchronizing the different input streams to create a coherent flow of information.
* The spinal cord and nerves are network cables, transferring information from the limbs and other regions of the body to the main processing unit, the brain.
* The eyes are digital cameras that can see into the world, converting photons into bits of data.
* The ears are microphones that can listen to a limited range of frequencies (20-20000 Hz).
* The mouth act as a speaker to emit sound for others to perceive
* Touch is complex as it deals with textures, temperatures, moisture and pressures, however it can likely be modeled as a surface with discrete elements that measure a few things such as the force currently applied on it, the temperature, moisture.
* Taste and smell are also complex as they are specialized receptors that will perceive different fragrances based on the distribution of particles that are perceived and that can be recognized.
* The arms, legs, hands, feet are actuators used to interact with the environment.
* The stomach and intestine are the power supply.
* Neurons throughout the body act as distributed memory and storage, as well as processing units.
* Blood is used as a mechanism to transfer energy between components. It also acts as a heatsink for the brain.
