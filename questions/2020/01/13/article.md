# Question
What do humans modeled as computers look like?

# Answer
* Numerous processes all running in parallel in different regions of the body (heartbeat, breathing)
* The brain runs multiple processes at once, each processing a different modal input (sight, taste, touch, hearing, smell)
* Those processes are buffered and a process takes care of synchronizing the different input streams to create a coherent flow of information
* Spinal cord and nerves are network cables, transferring information from the limbs and other regions of the body to the main processing unit (the brain)
* The eyes are digital cameras that can see into the world
* The ears are microphones that can listen to a limited range of frequencies
* Touch is complex as it deals with textures, temperatures, pressures, however it can likely be modeled as a surface with discrete elements that measure a few things such as the force currently applied on it, the temperature, moisture
* Taste and smell are also complex as they are specialized receptors that will create different fragrance based on the distribution of particles that are perceived (and that can be recognized)
* The arms, legs, hands, feet are actuators used to interact with the environment
* The stomach and intestine are the power supply
* Neurons throughout the body act as distributed memory and storage
