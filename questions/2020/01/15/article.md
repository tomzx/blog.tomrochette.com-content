# Question
Why is biology and genetics interesting to AGI researchers?

# Answer
Because it may provide interesting ideas and clues that can help with the development of AGI.

We currently know of a single instance of a system that is able to produce human level intelligence: a human being. As such, AGI researchers often try to understand how specific components, such as the brain, works. A lot of valuable work on the neuron has recently led to the explosion of the deep learning field. This work has definitely proven its value, but I am more interested about something that is less obvious.

Genetics is seen as the programming of life.
