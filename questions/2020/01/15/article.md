# Question
Why is biology and genetics interesting to AGI researchers?

# Answer
Because it may provide interesting ideas and clues that can help with the development of AGI.

We currently know of a single instance of a system that is able to produce human level intelligence: a human being. As such, AGI researchers often try to understand how specific components, such as the brain, works. A lot of valuable work on the neuron has recently led to the explosion of the deep learning field. This work has definitely proven its value, but I am more interested about something that is less obvious.

Genetics is seen as the programming of life. What I find interesting is that we can see the current human DNA as our latest implementation of this code. Since this code did not come out of existence out of no where, studying out DNA came to be can give us ideas as to how a seed AI might come to be.
