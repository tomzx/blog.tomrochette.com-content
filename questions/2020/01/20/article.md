# Question
What is the point of asking oneself many questions when few of them are actually answered?

# Answer
The purpose of asking yourself questions is to prompt your subconscious to look for the answer.

Asking yourself questions is a way to determine if you know or do not know the answer. If you don't know the answer, then nothing will come on the top of your head quickly. On the other hand, if you know an acceptable answer, it will show itself rather quickly.

Asking yourself questions is a way to explore the domain of your knowledge and look for areas where you might need to do additional research.

If you ask yourself a lot of questions on a certain topic you're studying and you don't know the answers, then it can let you know that your knowledge is lacking and that you need to study more.

In some cases you might ask yourself questions that you don't really want to know the answer to.
