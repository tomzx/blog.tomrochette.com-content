# Question
How can you efficiently store terabytes of data, with hundreds of gigabytes updated daily?

# Answer
This question comes from the idea that if we want to implement an artificial intelligence, it will have to be able to process a large amount of data, similar to how we need to process a stream of sensorial (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell) inputs actively more than 12 hours per day.

In human beings, even though we perceive a large amount of incoming data, a lot of it is compressed through differencing, that is, comparing the previous input with the new input and only storing the difference. This is similar to how video is currently encoded and compressed. To be able to accomplish this feat we however need two things: a temporary buffer to store the previous input, and a mechanism to differentiate between the previous and the current input.

That differentiation mechanism can be highly complex depending on the degree of compression desired. For example, if you shift all the pixels in an image by 1 on the x axis, your differentiation mechanism may simply tell you that all the pixels have changed, return a delta between their previous value and new value and be done. In some cases you may be lucky and a large amount of pixels have remained the same value. However, a much better differentiation mechanism would realize that everything has moved by one pixel on the x axis and instead return to you that it detected a x+=1 transform, which compresses the transformation a lot more than by the simple pixel by pixel difference.

I would expect such a system to make use of two types of compression: offline and online. Offline compression would occur during low periods of activity and would be able to offer higher levels of compression. Online compression would be happening when the system is actively being used.

Online compression would rely on a lookup dictionary to find blocks of data that have already been seen numerous times. The quality of the system depends highly on the assumption that what you will observe in the future is highly likely to be what you've observed in the past. During a day, we spend most of our time in the same environment. As such, we experience and observe the same things for an extended amount of time. Being able to determine what is similar and what is different is what will lead to the highest amount of compression.

Offline compression would rely on the ability to make the most efficient use of the compute and memory available.

In the brain we make use of the fact that the sensory inputs are different modes. Each is compressed somewhat separately from the others. As such, we would expect information that is similar in format to be compressed together (text with text, video with video, audio with audio, etc.) as it is likely to lead to the highest compression. Furthermore, being able to make use of the structure within the data will lead to better compression than simply compressing blindly a collection of inputs as an opaque blob.
