# Question
Will an AGI be superior to a group of individuals (e.g., a society or company)?

# Answer
Most likely.

An AGI may be a strong single minded entity. Unlike societies and companies that are composed of numerous individuals with different values/beliefs/opinions (VBO), an AGI is expected to have a single set of clear, concise and non-contradicting VBO. An AGI should be able to explore all potential alternatives and reason about all the potential sets of VBO in order to determine the most coherent and appropriate set to hold.

Meanwhile, we as individuals hold VBO that are often inconsistent. As a group, we are heterogenous in our VBO which means that conflict will arise since not all VBO can be the VBO of the group. Our biggest issue is that we are competitive by nature. People will fight over resources if they are limited. Fighting will lead to winners and losers. The winners may not be necessarily the individuals with the "best" set of VBO, which sounds unlikely to lead us to produce the optimal solution to a desired goal.
