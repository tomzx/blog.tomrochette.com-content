# Question
What are the tools I use daily that I could contribute to?

# Answer
## General
* [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) My text editor of choice when I don't need an IDE. I've implemented a few plugins for VSC and use it daily to write personal notes as well as blog articles. I sometimes make use of its diff tool to merge changes from Sourcetree.
