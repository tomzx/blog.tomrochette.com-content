# Question
What are the differences between a brain and a CPU?

# Answer
* The brain is extremely parallel, while CPUs are currently limited to a few cores.
* The brain appears to be able to only do a single thing at once (single process, single thread).
* CPUs can freely control their memory access while the brain memory organization and access is unclear.
* The brain is a lot slower in terms of sequential operations, processing at a maximum of 250-1000 Hz.
* The brain does not have a clear instruction set.
* The brain consumes glucose for energy, while a CPU consumes electricity

## To be determined
* The brain may not have different levels of memory cache (we do however talk about short and long term memory).
