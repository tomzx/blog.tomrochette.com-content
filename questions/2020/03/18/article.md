# Problem
Why should you read technical books?

# Solution
Because they can teach you. Good technical books will expand your understanding of the topic covered in the book. It will clarify concepts you had trouble grasping before, allowing you to make good use of this newly acquired knowledge.

Because they give you more abilities. As you acquire new knowledge, you can make use of it. This lets you do things you could not do before because of this lack of knowledge.

Because they can change you. If you read about someone else's approach to problem solving, you may come to prefer their way of solving problem. By being convinced by the author, you may be led to change how you write code, what you think is important about building software, how you prioritize your work, etc.
