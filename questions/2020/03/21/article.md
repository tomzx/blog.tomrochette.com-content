# Question
Why do I avoid reading books sometimes?

# Answer
The most common reason for me to avoid reading a book is that I see reading as an investment. I can't spend only 5 minutes reading a book there and there. I need to focus on reading for at least 15 minutes, otherwise I cannot enjoy the story or understand the technical book I'm reading.

This creates a problem. For me to read, I need to have enough time to read for at least 15 minutes. 15 minutes is a considerable amount of time to allocate vs no time allocation to simply browse content online. Thus a barrier is created, making it harder to read books.

Similarly, there are times where I don't want to read a book because I want to process a unit of the story or a chapter of the book in one reading. It is similar to not wanting to start a tv show episode knowing that you might stop watching it in the middle. I don't like that.

Reading technical books is mentally draining. Sometimes I'm simply brain dead and reading books is simply not possible.
