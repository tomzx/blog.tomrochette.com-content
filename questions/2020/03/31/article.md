# Question
What do I look for in a resume?

# Answer
Let's start by the things I don't look at in a resume for a position in which experience is expected:
* **Your university:** I couldn't care less where you've studied. While having a university may sometimes tell me you've been serious enough to go through the pain of university, I also know it's possible to go through university without acquiring any knowledge.
* **Your extra-curricular activities:** Unless you are doing extra-curricular activities that are relevant to the position you are applying for, I am not filtering for people with whom I could do things with outside of work.
* **The list of all your publications:** I work in a scientific field, and while for some publications are badges of success, I see listing of articles as filler into a resume. If I want to know all the articles you've published, I can look it up on Google Scholar. Instead, focus on listing the areas of research you're interested in and indicating how many papers in those areas you've published.
