# Question
What do I look for in a resume?

# Answer
Let's start by the things I don't look at in a resume for a position in which experience is expected:
* **Your university:** I couldn't care less where you've studied. While having a university may sometimes tell me you've been serious enough to go through the pain of university, I also know it's possible to go through university without acquiring any knowledge.
* **Your extra-curricular activities:** Unless you are doing extra-curricular activities that are relevant to the position you are applying for, I am not filtering for people with whom I could do things with outside of work.
* **The list of all your publications:** I work in a scientific field, and while for some publications are badges of success, I see listing of articles as filler into a resume. If I want to know all the articles you've published, I can look it up on Google Scholar. Instead, focus on listing the areas of research you're interested in and indicating how many papers in those areas you've published.

Here are the things I look for:
* **2-3 pages:** If you cannot summarize your accomplishments in less than 3 pages, then you don't know how to summarize. I don't want to know everything you've done in your professional life. I don't want to know every single paper you've published, every conference/workshop you've attended, every grant you've received, every honors you have.
* **What you studied in university:** I expect people that apply to the positions I filter for to belong into a certain set of domains. This is generally not a very important criteria, but it gives me a better idea of your professional career.
* **When you finished your degree:** This is used to determine how recent your education is. I consider professional experience once the degree is completed, not while it is being completed.
