# Question
How is being a R&D developer different than being a developer?

# Answer
R&D developers are not focused on shipping. While most developers will work as hard as possible to ship whatever they are building to their customers so that they can get paid, R&D developers focus is on delivering answers to questions asked by their clients.

Because of this, it is very common that code written in R&D will not make it in production. It also means that code quality is not considered a priority because code is expected to be abandoned once the questions have been answered.
