# Question
How is being a R&D developer different than being a developer?

# Answer
R&D developers are not focused on shipping. While most developers will work as hard as possible to ship whatever they are building to their customers so that they can get paid, R&D developers focus on delivering answers to questions asked by their clients. This focus on intangible deliverables will frustrate many developers.

Because of this, it is very common that code written in R&D will not make it in production. It also means that code quality is not considered a priority because code is expected to be abandoned once the questions have been answered. Maintenance is also not considered a priority.

R&D as it implies, is about finding solutions quickly to problems and demonstrating the value of the solution. While most development will use pre-existing solutions or will have a general idea on how to solve a client's problem, R&D development is exploratory. Although any software engineer will be able to come up with a solution using existing technology, this solution will have to be built and proven to work.
