# Problem
Why should you read fiction books?

# Solution
Because they can motivate you. An exciting story to which you can relate may motivate you to try and emulate it.

Because they can make you think. Some authors have been alive for a lot longer than you have and they've had longer to think about certain topics to which you never really dedicated any time. Some may have acquired a deeper and broader understanding of a certain domain they can then use to turn fiction into an epic story.

Because they can help you be more creative.

Because they can help you disconnect.
