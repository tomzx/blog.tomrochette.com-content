# Question
What tools do I use daily at work?

# Answer
* [Notion.so](http://notion.so/) I use Notion.so to track my day to day tasks and their progress. I also use it to write down any idea I have during the day that I would like to explore at some point in the future. I've described my [task management system in more details](http://blog.tomrochette/processes/task-management).
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Google suite (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides)](https://gsuite.google.com/)
