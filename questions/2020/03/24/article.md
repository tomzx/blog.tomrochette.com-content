# Question
How do you document a process?

# Answer
A process is composed of a few things: inputs (dependencies), outputs and the steps to transform inputs into outputs.

Generally a new process will be created from a need (output). For example, a client will come to you and ask to have software that does Y. Your output in this case is a software that does Y. For the customer, the process they need you to develop is one where X (some unknown set of inputs) will be transformed to produce Y.

As a software developer, your task is two-fold.
First, you must develop a process for yourself to take a client's requirements (your input X) and convert it into software (your output Y), which means figuring out what needs to be done from X to Y (the transformation steps).
Second, you must develop a process for your client's requirements, that is, one that convert some input information into their desired ability to produce Y.
