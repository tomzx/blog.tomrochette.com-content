# Question
How do you estimate the size of a project roughly?

# Answer
When I am asked to provide a rough estimate of the required effort on a project with a lot of requirements or user stories, I first want to make sure that my estimate is in the right order of magnitude. That means that I want to estimate a project that takes 1-10 weeks to be in that range, but not estimate less than a week or more than 10 weeks. Similarly, a project that takes one or more years should not estimated as a job of a few weeks.

My orders of magnitude are as follows:
* 1 day
* 1 week (5 days)
* 1 month (20 days)
* 1 quarter (60 days)
* 1 half-year (120/125 days)
* 1 year (250 days)

As such, when estimating a task, I will say that the task will either take 1 day, 1 week or 1 month. In general, any task that is estimated at 1 month long (or above) needs to be broken down into sub-tasks as it indicates that the task is hiding a lot of complexity.

With this kind of approach, one can estimate that a developer can do approximately 250 small tasks (1 day), 50 medium tasks (5 days) or 13 large tasks (20 days) per year.
