# Question
What is the superficial loss rule applied to stocks and how does it impact me?

# Answer
The superficial loss rule states:

> A superficial loss can occur when you dispose of capital property for a loss and both of the following conditions are met:
>
> * You, or a person affiliated with you, buys, or has a right to buy, the same or identical property (called "substituted property") during the period starting 30 calendar days before the sale and ending 30 calendar days after the sale.
> * You, or a person affiliated with you, still owns, or has a right to buy, the substituted property 30 calendar days after the sale.

What this effectively does is that it prevents you from selling at a loss and rebuying the same stock within a 30 days period for the purpose of tax harvesting during that year. This however does not prevent you from claiming the loss when you finally sell the stock.
