# Question
What do I look for in a library before using it in a project?

# Answer
It has to be maintained so that I know that issues are addressed.

It has to be supported so that I know I'll get help if needed.

It has to be highly used compared to other solutions to ensure it's more feature complete and of good quality compare to other libraries.

It has documentation so that I don't have to read the documentation to know how to use the library for common cases.

It has to have a simple API that does what I need so that I don't have to deal with weird/incomplete API that do half of what I need.
