# Question
Why should I write using simple vocabulary?

# Answer
Using simple language will allow more people to understand your message.

Using simple vocabulary to explain complex ideas makes it easier to understand those ideas.

It's also easier to identify errors in logic and reasoning when you're expressing yourself with simple language.

Using complex vocabulary does not mean that you have smarter or more complex ideas. It simply means you're trying to conceal yourself in vocabulary that others may not understand.

Like writing software, you should aim to keep your writing simple. It makes it easier on the readers that don't have to spend their time to decrypt what you're trying to say.
