# Question
Why should I write using simple vocabulary?

# Answer
* You can be understood by more people
* using complex vocabulary doesn't mean complex ideas
* using simple vocabulary to explain complex ideas makes it easier to understand, possibly leading to the use of metaphors
* it's easier to identify mistakes when they are expressed in simple language
* like software, prefer simplicity over complexity
