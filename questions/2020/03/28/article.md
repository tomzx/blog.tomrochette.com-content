# Question
Why should I write using simple, frequently used words?

# Answer
Using simple language will allow more people to understand your message.

Using simple words to explain ideas that are more involved makes it easier to understand those ideas.

It's also easier to identify errors in reasoning when you're expressing yourself with simple language.

Using rare words does not mean that you are more intelligent or have smart thoughts. It simply means you're trying to conceal yourself by using words others may not understand.

Like writing software, you should aim to keep your writing simple. It makes it easier on the readers that don't have to spend their time to understand what you're trying to say.

Writing such articles is very difficult. For example, this article was written using only the 5000 most common words according to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000).
