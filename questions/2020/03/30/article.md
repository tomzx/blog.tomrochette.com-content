# Question
What is data profiling?

# Answer
Data profiling is the process of extracting information about data. Given tabular data (think of an Excel spreadsheet), we commonly want to extract the following properties about each column:
* number of rows
* number of cells without data
* number of cells with a value of zero
* number of distinct/unique values
