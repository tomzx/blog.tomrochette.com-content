# Question
How can I read more books?

# Answer
Make it a priority to read books. Replace some of the existing habits you have with reading books instead.

If you like to spend time reading reddit or hackernews or watching videos on youtube, replace that with reading a book. Of course, it's easier said than done. The best way I've been able to transition from those activities to reading books was to progress slowly. Don't replace reading hackernews one day by reading a book instead. Instead, simply spend 5, 10, 15 minutes reading a book, and then the remainder of the time on reading hackernews. Spend the same amount of time every day reading a book for a week. When a week has passed, increase that amount of time slightly (e.g., go from 5 minutes per day to 10 minutes per day).

As you increase the amount of time you read, you will find it easier and easier to spend time reading instead of doing other activities you might consider harmful or less valuable.
