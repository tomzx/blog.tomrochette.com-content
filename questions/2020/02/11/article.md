# Question
What does a productive meeting looks like?

# Answer
There are a few people invited, less than 6 ideally. Everyone invited knows why they are in the meeting and will contribute to the discussion.

An agenda for the meeting has been set, with a pre-determined amount of time for each item on the agenda. One person is responsible to make sure that the agenda is followed and that the time is respected.

Notes are taken by the different individuals.

Items that appear to require more discussion than anticipated are noted and the involved individuals may spend additional time outside of the meeting to make their point, either through another meeting or by writing a document explaining their position.

A list of actionable items is defined at the end of the meeting and responsibles are assigned to those items. Deadlines are also assigned to those items so that people can expect those items to be completed by the define date.
