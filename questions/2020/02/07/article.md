# Question
If I were a billionaire, how would I live my life?

# Answer
I would invest a good chunk of my money in doing research in the fields I'm interested in, namely computer science, software engineering and artificial intelligence.

I would spend my time trying to define what is the most important thing we could be working on at the moment given our current understanding and constraints in order to reach certain objectives:
* being able to replace any process we currently do on computers, the most interesting one being to write programs given a natural language description of the requirements

I would want to get informed by the advice of the smartest people I can get. I would avoid having to deal with hardware constraints by simply purchasing more hardware. I'd try to trade the money I have to remove as much friction as possible in my work. I would like to consider working on different things as having a variety of hobbies.
