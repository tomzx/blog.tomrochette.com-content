# Question
If I were a billionaire, how would I live my life?

# Answer
I would invest a good chunk of my money in doing research in the fields I'm interested in, namely biology, genetics, computer science, software engineering, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I would spend my time trying defining what is the most important thing I could be working on given our current understanding and constraints in order to reach certain objectives.
I would want to get informed by the advice of the smartest people I can get.
I would pay others to help me get to my goals faster.
I would avoid having to deal with hardware constraints by simply purchasing more hardware.
I'd try to trade the money I have to remove as much friction as possible in my work.
I would like to consider working on different things as having a variety of hobbies.
I would avoid spending my time commuting.
I would maximize the effectiveness of my time, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep.
