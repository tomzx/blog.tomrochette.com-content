# Question
If you offload everything in your head into documents, how long does it take before you start repeating yourself?

# Answer
How soon you repeat yourself will depend on how much diversity there is in your thoughts. If you always think about the same problems in the same ways, you're likely to repeat yourself a lot. However, if you try to explore the same problems through different lenses you'll have less chances to repeat yourself.

If you spend most of your time exploring new ideas, then you may only come back to ideas you had in the past from time to time.

If you work in a certain specialized field you may have to learn the basics again and again and again in order to master them. This will mean that you will think about the same topic numerous times, sometimes having acquired new knowledge that might challenge your existing assumptions.

When we offload everything that we have in our head into documents, our goal is to have more space for our current work while writing down somewhere the work we've already done on a topic. We want to avoid having to come back to the same topics again and having to start our exploration from scratch. When we're exploring, we want to avoid exploring the same topics without noticing. We also want to be able to get an idea of the size of the knowledge necessary to master a topic.
