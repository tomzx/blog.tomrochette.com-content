# Question
Is it better for society to keep the employees of a corrupted company in that company or have them apply and join other companies?

# Answer
I am of the opinion that it is better for corruption not to spread. I'd hope that by having the (potentially) corrupted individuals join other companies, that the culture of the companies they join would prevent them from corrupting those companies. Either the corrupted individuals would have to stop being corruptors (in the future, which would be ideal), or be evicted of the "healthy" company in order to avoid fostering this behavior.

One issue with corrupted employees spreading to other companies is that it is difficult to identify them as they hide in those various companies. It is possible for us to establish a blacklist of companies that exhibited bad behaviors and avoiding employing people who worked there. This approach may however punish employees that are not corrupted.

What companies and individuals within the healthy companies need is a way to identify individuals that are likely to be corrupted or corruptible. The difficulty is however that those individuals are likely to be cunning, which means that no single technique will always succeed at identifying them.
