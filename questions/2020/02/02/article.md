# Question
Is it better to keep the employees of a corrupted company in that company or have them apply and join other companies?

# Answer
I am of the opinion that it is better for corruption not to spread. I'd hope that by having the (potentially) corrupted individuals join other companies, that the culture of the companies they join would prevent them from corrupting those companies. Either the corrupted individuals would have to stop being corruptors (in the future, which would be ideal), or be evicted of the "healthy" company in order to avoid fostering this behavior.

One issue with corrupted employees spreading to other companies is that it is difficult to identify them as they hide in those various companies. Similarly to how if we could identify a single host containing multiple viruses one "easy" approach to getting rid of those viruses would be to get rid of the host itself. When the virus has spread across many hosts it becomes difficult to identify the initial source.

Much like how we track viruses, what companies and individuals within those companies need is a way to identify individuals that are likely to be corrupted or corruptable.
