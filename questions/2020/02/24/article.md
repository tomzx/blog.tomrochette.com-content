# Question
How is value defined in a business context?

# Answer
For a solution to be valuable it must solve an actual problem. Having a solution to a problem the business does not have will actually create a problem.

If a need exist for the solution, then the solution must do one or many of the following:
* Reduction in cost/time: reduce human resources needed to produce the same results
* Increase in quality: Increase accuracy/repeatability of a process
* Solve a problem that could not be solved previously
* Significant impact on cost for improving an already solved problem
* Offer the ability to scale the process without having to scale the necessary human support linearly with the growth of the process
* Help with identifying the most important pieces of the business in order to follow the 20/80 principle
