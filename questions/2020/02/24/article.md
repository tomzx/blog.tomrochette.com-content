# Question
How is value defined in a business context?

# Answer
For a solution to be valuable it must solve an actual problem.

If a need exist for the solution, then the solution must do one or many of the following:
* Reduce costs/time: reduce human resources needed to produce the same results
* Increase quality: Increase accuracy/repeatability of a process
* Solve a problem that could not be solved previously
* Have a significant impact on costs for improving an already solved problem
* Offer the ability to scale the process without having to scale the necessary human support linearly with the growth of the process
* Help with identifying the most important pieces of the business in order to follow the [80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
