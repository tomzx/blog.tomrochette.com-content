# Question
How do I write my questions and problems articles?

# Answer
The process I use to write both my [questions articles](../../../) and my [problems articles](../../../../problems) is quite similar, so I will summarize both in this article.

The process is as follows:
* Find the question or problem to cover.
	* To find questions, I will look at the notes I have taken in the past and search for question marks. I answer those questions as a way to stimulate my brain to think about questions I may rarely have the time to answer.
	* To find problems, I will look at my github repositories. When I encounter a problem at work, I try to write it down so I can describe the issue in more details, which may hopefully help someone in a similar situation in the future.
* Think about the question or problem for a little while, to see what I can come up with.
* Write a list of items that I want to cover, this acts as my plan.
* Detail the items in the list in more details.
* Reference articles I've already written on the same topic.
* Review the article using [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) for grammatical mistakes and typos.
