# Question
Why do I track how much time I read and how many pages I've read?

# Answer
It allows me to have an idea of how long a book will take me to read. It also allows me to determine over time if I'm getting slower or faster reading books by using a website like [How Long to Read](https://howlongtoread.com/). While the website says that reading a book such as [Liu Cixin's Death's End](https://howlongtoread.com/books/191142/Deaths-End) should take 10h to read to the average reader at 300 WPM, it took me more than 20h to read it, which means I'm a very slow reader and that I read at less than 150 WPM.

The benefit of knowing how long a book will take me to read is that I can decide if I want to actually spend that time finishing the book or not. When a book is good, this question is not considered, but when it is bad, it is important to decide whether spending more time is a worthwhile use of my time.
