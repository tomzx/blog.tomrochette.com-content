# Question
I do I track my thoughts?

# Answer
When I am on the go, I mostly rely on [Google Keep](http://keep.google.com/) to write down what on my mind. I use it because it loads fast, is straightforward and allows me to quickly dump my thought and go back to what I was doing. Since I'm always with my phone, it's always within reach. It also will synchronize with Google when I'm online so it is available on any other devices. This also means that I may sometimes record things either directly from my computer, my work computer, my phone or my tablet, depending on the medium I'm using at the time (defaulting to my phone if I'm not using any device when the thought crops up).

When I am at home, I've devised a simple system in Visual Studio Code where I use two keyboard shortcut, one that open today's buffer (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad 2</kbd>) and one that inserts a datetime and note id on the current line (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad 0</kbd>).
