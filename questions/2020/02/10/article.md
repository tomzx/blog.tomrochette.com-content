# Question
Why don't we always work on the most important task?

# Answer
For bad reasons:
* We don't know what is the most important task at the moment.
* We don't want to work on the most important task.
* The most important task feels overwhelming.
* The most important task seems too risky.
* The most important task doesn't seem fun to work on.
* We think that the task we're working on is more important, but it isn't.

For good reasons:
* The most important task has prerequisites that need to be completed before it can be done.
* The most important task is being done by someone else already.
* The importance of tasks is likely to change soon due to to a change in objectives.
