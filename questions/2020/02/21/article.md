# Question
What are different ways to measure intelligence?

# Answer
We can measure intelligence as:
* the number of CPU cycles necessary to solve a problem. Less is better.
* the amount of energy spent by a system to solve a problem. Less is better.
* the time necessary to solve a problem. Less is better.

The benefit of all those measurements is that they are scalar and thus ordinal, creating an order between the different agents that can successfully solve the problem.

# Reference
* [Intelligence](../../../../agi/intelligence)
