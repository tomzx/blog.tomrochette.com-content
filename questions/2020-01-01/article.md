# Question
Is reducing our size a viable alternative/approach to space exploration?

# Answer
I don't have enough knowledge of physics to determine all the impacts that scaling down would have. There are a few things I would consider, such as:
* the impact on being launched in space
* our ability to accelerate/decelerate in space
* our ability to send communication signals back on earth

When I asked myself this question, I was reading Accelerando
