# Question
Is reducing our size a viable alternative/approach to space exploration?

# Answer
I don't have enough knowledge of physics to determine all the impacts that scaling down would have. There are a few things I would consider, such as:
* the impact on being launched in space
* our ability to accelerate/decelerate in space
* our ability to send communication signals back on earth

When I asked myself this question, I was reading [Accelerando](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17863.Accelerando), where a crew is sent far in space in a "can". I always perceived it as being the size of a soft drink can and I thought that was an interesting idea. In the book they are not shipping human beings, but rather a simulation of their consciousness. In other words, they're sending an AI in a can.
