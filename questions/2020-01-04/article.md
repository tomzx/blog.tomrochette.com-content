# Question
How do you prioritize things when there are so many of them competing against one another?

# Answer
My approach to task prioritization, assuming that you have a list of tasks with no other information, involves adding information that will help you prioritize them.

Assuming you are using a issue tracking system like Redmine, Notion.so or JIRA, I would add two new fields to each task: important and urgent. This approach is based on the [Eisenhower method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) of time management. You will want to go through all the tasks and determine whether they are important and whether they are urgent.
