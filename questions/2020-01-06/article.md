# Question
How can I easily identify the next book I should read when I have over 500 to choose from?

# Answer
My first heuristic when deciding which book to read is to consider how many people have already read it by using a site such as goodreads. The reason is that I want to read books that I may be able to discuss with others who will also have (possibly) read the book. Reading niche books might be interesting, but it makes discussing them a lot more difficult.

For fiction books, I will generally read books from a collection I've enjoyed at least one book. You could basically consider it the book "social" proofing. For new books that are not part of a collection and from authors I've never read, I will most likely decide based on my interests of the moment.

For non-fiction/technical books, I will generally skim through a few books on the same topic and determine which book I feel the most confident will provide me with the most information provided in the most appropriate and succinct way.

I suggest using a book tracker like goodreads as it will allow you to track when you added the book to your list. This will let you know how long the book has been sitting there, waiting to be read. Generally, the longer a book stays "shelved" the less likely it is you will ever read it. This also generalizes to the idea that most books are read in a FILO fashion (first in, last out).
