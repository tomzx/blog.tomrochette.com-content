# Question
How can I easily identify the next book I should read when I have over 500 to choose from?

# Answer
My first heuristic when deciding which book to read is to consider how many people have already read it by using a site such as goodreads. The reason is that I want to read books that I may be able to discuss with others who will also have (possibly) read the book. Reading niche books might be interesting, but it makes discussing them a lot more difficult.

For fiction books, I will generally read books from a collection I've enjoyed at least one book. You could basically consider it the book "social" proofing. For new books that are not part of a collection and from authors I've never read, I will most likely decide based on my interests of the moment.

For non-fiction/technical books, I will generally skim through a few books on the same topic and determine which book I feel the most confident will provide me with the most information provided in the most appropriate and succint way.
