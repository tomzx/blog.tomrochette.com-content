In 2020, I decided that I would answer one question I had per day. Every day I ask myself hundreds of questions, but I write down only a few of them because they require a lot more thought.

As of 2020-01-01, I have been writing notes daily in text files, writing down questions I asked myself and that I might answer at some point in the future. Since April 14, 2017 I have written approximately 988 questions (over 992 days).

Answering our own questions is the best way to increase our knowledge. By understanding where our understanding is lacking can we improve.
