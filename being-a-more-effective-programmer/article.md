## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How to more efficiently develop complex algorithms
* How to be more careful when writing new code
* How to spend less time debugging

# Overview

# Notes
* Write test cases
* Execute your test cases often
* Take a step back from time to time to observe your existing solution
* Understand the requirements of your problems
* Understand the time and space complexity requirements
* Simulate program execution
* Run the program step by step using the debugger and think about the (desired) state at each point
* Make explicit (write/explain) the important parts of the algorithms
* Go through code you have issue writing yourself with someone else to see how they reason about it
