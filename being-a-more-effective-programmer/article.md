## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How to more efficiently develop complex algorithms
* How to be more careful when writing new code
* How to spend less time debugging
* Is writing a working solution better than thinking about a better alternative solution to develop straight away?
* How to recognize where to look for the source of a problem/bug?

# Overview

# Notes
* Write test cases
* Execute your test cases often
* Take a step back from time to time to observe your existing solution and attempt to determine if it is too complex for what it is trying to solve
* Understand the problem
* Understand the requirements of your problems
* Understand the time and space complexity requirements
* Simulate program execution
* Run the program step by step using the debugger and think about the (desired) state at each point
* Make explicit (write/explain) the important parts/steps of the algorithms
* Pseudo-code your solution, then implement it
* Go through code you have issue writing yourself with someone else to see how they reason about it
* Deliberately practice the aspects of programming you have difficulty with
	* Practice going through code challenges not for the purpose of solving the problem, but observing how you solve the problem and where you could improve
* Break the problem into parts and solve the parts
* Do not optimize for speed, optimize for readability/understandability/transparency

## 2018-05-12
* Start with the simplest cases you want to support, then proceed to more and more difficult cases
* Verify your progress in small iterations to prevent writing a lot and then having to make it all work
* Identify the variables that you need through an iterative process
* Write in comments the alternative options you have
* Sometimes you will discover that what you took for granted is not necessarily correct (such as template code provided to you that does not accomplish what it states it does)

### When a function is not working as expected
* Check the problem definition
