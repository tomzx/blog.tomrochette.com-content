# Preface
This article is a way for me to share what I think is a better way to go through the content I've gone through in order to learn AGI, which you can read at [my path to AGI](../my-path-to-agi/article.md).

If you have comments and suggestions, feel free to let me know through the comments!

# Prerequisites
In this section, I list all the topics that generally serves as foundation for more advanced topics. It is not necessary to go through all of the prerequisites, but it will definitely improve your odds of understanding more complex theories down the road. Furthermore, they will provide you with useful tools and abstractions.

## Linear algebra
No book suggestion yet.

## Discrete mathematics
* [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.ca/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0073383090/)

## Logic
* [A Concise Introduction to Logic](https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Introduction-Logic-Book-Only/dp/0840034164)

## Set theory
* [Naive Set Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Set-Theory-Paul-Halmos/dp/1781394660)

## Calculus
### Differential
No book suggestion yet.

### Integral
No book suggestion yet.

### Vector
No book suggestion yet.

### Multivariable
No book suggestion yet.

## Programming
No book suggestion yet.

As most scientific programming is done in Python nowadays (2015-2017), it is highly suggested to get familiar with the language.
