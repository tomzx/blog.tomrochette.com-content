## Context

In the movie [Automata](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1971325/), there is a particularly interesting scene with the following monologue:

> Before the first pilgrim was manufactured, there was a precedent. It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab. But it was a genuine unit with no restrictions and no protocols.
> During eight days, we had a free flowing dialog with that unit. We learned from it and it learned from us. But then, as some of us had predicted, the day when it no longed needed our help arrived and it started to learn by itself.
> On the ninth day, the dialog came to a halt. It wasn't that it stopped communicating with us, it was we stopped being able to understand it. And then we learned the most important lesson about automatons, we have to limit their intelligence, tailor it to a human minds' measure.
