# Overview

The most general questions every AGI researcher needs to answer include[^1]:
* What is AGI, accurately specified?
* Is it possible to build the AGI as specified?
* If AGI is possible, what is the most plausible way to achieve it?
* Even if we know how to achieve AGI, should we really do it?

A complete AGI work normally includes[^1]:
* a theory of intelligence,
* a formal model of the theory,
* a computational implementation of the model.

Define the problems and questions you are trying to solve.

* This is what I am solving
* This is what I am building
* This is how I am solving it
* Here is how we can think about it now

---

* State the problem you want to solve in general terms
* Collect previous work related to your research
* Understand the material
* Implement the ideas found in previous work
* Specify your problem in details
* Think (and use Pólya How to Solve It)
* Implement your idea and compare it/Review
* Report/Publish
* Discuss topic with colleagues

---

* Good research should be novel:
	* Describe state-of-the-art (SotA)
	* Describe state-of-the-pratice (SotP)
	* Describe how your work is different from them
* Good research should be relevant:
	* Consider what problems we face today or are likely to face within some time span
	* Consider what other researchers and practitioners problems are and what they consider important
* Good research should present generalities/principles
* Good research is often systematic and structured
	* Systematic: You have a clear idea of what to do and that this will clearly "cover" the most likely relevant aspects
	* Structured: There is good "logic" and "flow" in what you are trying to do and how you describe it
* Good research claims something and validate those claims

* Focus on a part of your subject area that is limited so that you can go deep in 40-150 papers
* Create a taxonomy of the papers you find
