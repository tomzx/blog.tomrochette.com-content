## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Extract references automatically based on what is said in a text

# Overview

# My approach
* Create a directory on my computer where I store everything related to my research
* For each topic I find interesting, create a directory within that directory and start collecting information about the topic. It might be ideas, questions, notes, url of relevant websites, book titles, authors, etc.
* Frequently go through the list of directories in the main directory in order to review the state of each "project" and add new ideas, questions and information when appropriate
* From time to time a project may take a good amount of my time. For instance, if I become interested in handwriting recognition, I might do a lot of research on the topic and thus update the content of the directory more frequently than for other topics which I might only have had a cursory interest

I have two systems I use to approach research:
	* reading about theory and then devising projects
	* devising projects and reading the appropriate theory

# Approaches suggested by others
## Pei Wang
The most general questions every AGI researcher needs to answer include:
* What is AGI, accurately specified?
* Is it possible to build the AGI as specified?
* If AGI is possible, what is the most plausible way to achieve it?
* Even if we know how to achieve AGI, should we really do it?

A complete AGI work normally includes:
* a theory of intelligence,
* a formal model of the theory,
* a computational implementation of the model.

## Unknown
Define the problems and questions you are trying to solve.

* This is what I am solving
* This is what I am building
* This is how I am solving it
* Here is how we can think about it now

## Kyungnam Kim
* State the problem you want to solve in general terms
* Collect previous work related to your research
* Understand the material
* Implement the ideas found in previous work
* Specify your problem in details
* Think (and use PÃ³lya How to Solve It)
* Implement your idea and compare it/Review
* Report/Publish
* Discuss topic with colleagues

## Robert Feldt
* Good research should be novel:
	* Describe state-of-the-art (SotA)
	* Describe state-of-the-practice (SotP)
	* Describe how your work is different from them
* Good research should be relevant:
	* Consider what problems we face today or are likely to face within some time span
	* Consider what other researchers and practitioners problems are and what they consider important
* Good research should present generalities/principles
* Good research is often systematic and structured
	* Systematic: You have a clear idea of what to do and that this will clearly "cover" the most likely relevant aspects
	* Structured: There is good "logic" and "flow" in what you are trying to do and how you describe it
* Good research claims something and validates those claims

* Focus on a part of your subject area that is limited so that you can go deep in 40-150 papers
* Create a taxonomy of the papers you find
