## Context
The ultimate goal of a simple AGI program is to be able to receive a set of inputs and to produce the desired output while having as little input from the user.

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Supported problems
* X to Y mapping
* Delayed X to Y mapping (the Y value should be produced with a delay t in the output sequence)

# Requirements
* The user must define inputs and outputs that are to be learned in order to reduce the problems' space
* In some cases, the black box agent should be able to generate optimal solutions given constraints
