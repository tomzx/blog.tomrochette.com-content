# Overview
Software development can start at two different points: from a problem or from a solution. In the first case no existing software exist and we're trying to solve a problem. In the second case, we're trying to improve an existing solution.

* [Analysis/Requirements](../automated-requirements/article.md)
  * Decompose the problem into smaller problems
  * Identify the entities involved
  * Define the relationships between the entities
* Design
  * Generate a solution to the problem
  * Identify the steps to solve the problem
* Planning
  * Identify dependencies between steps
* [Implementation](../automated-programming/article.md)
  * Write code
  * Review code
  * Execute code
* Test
* [Debug](../automated-defect-correction/article.md)
* Deployment
* Maintenance
