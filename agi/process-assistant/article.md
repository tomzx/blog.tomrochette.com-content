## Context
All jobs contain a large amount of repetitive work. This repetitive work may be described at a high level using what is called a process. It is quite common for most workers to have an internal procedure for the different things they do, but it is very rare that you will find explicit procedures. The idea of the procedure assistant is to help workers define their implicit procedures in an attempt to make them explicit and allow them to share these procedures and improve them.

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Design and improve your processes
* Work through tasks using a process, where you record what you do, so that you may leave the task and come back to it later and have information about its last state
* Are there any DAG to programming language converter?
* How do you determine the beginning/end of a workflow (subroutine boundaries)?
* What is the easiest format to share this sort of information with others?
	* It has to be easy to compare such that others with their own processes may compare them against yours
		* This would potentially require the development of a restricted language so that nodes may be matched between graphs

# Overview
One of the biggest challenges of making procedures explicit is taking the time to do so. Doing so is a meta exercise that very few find of interest. Furthermore, this exercise is complicated by the fact that many activities are guided by some form of preemption (interrupting a task being carried out), which may make them harder to write down.

The most common tool used to make a process explicit is the directed acyclic graph. In it, each task/action is a node and each directed arrow indicates from which task to which task one may proceed.

# Purposes/Benefits
* Can be visually inspected
* Can be shared with others to gather feedback
* Can be automated
* Can be stored and retrieved later (allowing you to forget about it and rapidly get back to it)

# Steps
* Create a new process
* Write down as many steps you do implicitly
* Link steps to one another
* Follow the process
* Revise as needed
* Extract reusable processes into their own process graph

# Tools
* Workflow/Flow chart
	* Track the most popular paths
* Checklist
	* Track the most used items

# Notes
* Processes should be archived as they change. This allows you to observe which processes change often, and which parts change the most
