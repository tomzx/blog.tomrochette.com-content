# Marr's criteria for judging an AI research achievements
* What information processing problem has been solved?
* Has a clean theory been developed for solving it, and if so how good are the arguments that support it?
* If no clean theory has been given what is the evidence that favors a set-of-processes solution or suggests that no single clean theory exists for it, and how well does the proposed set of mechanisms work?
