## Context

The goal of this activity is to write down all the keywords and concepts that I can relate to AI. It can help you figure out the things you are working around a lot and help you figure out where you might be lacking some knowledge.

If possible, I'd suggest you use a software such as [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) and instead of building a list like the one below, that you build a knowledge graph, such as my [AGI Concept Map](https://github.com/tomzx/agi-concept-map). This will allow you to both think about the concepts you know, as well as their relations with other concepts you know about.
