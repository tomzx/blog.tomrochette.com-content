## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Notes
## 1. Why Semantics?
* Semantics: symbols can refer to things or concepts, and sequences of symbols convey meaning
* Ways to model data
	* Tabular Data
		* Easy to understand and formulate
		* Fields which contain more than a single piece of information are harder to use/parse
		* The models are rigid, limited and usually not changeable by the users
	* Relational Data
		* Fast and powerful tools for storing large sets of data where the data model is well understood and the usage patterns are fairly predictable
		* Pivot tables are essentially tables that indicate equality between two other tables entries
		* Schema migration is often a huge headache
	* Semantic Relationships
		* Extremely flexible, adaptible to new changes describing the data
		* Gets rid of normalization, degrades performance, columns type cannot be set/constrained

## 2. Expressing Meaning
* The triple is the fundamental building block of semantic representations
* It is composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object
* A subject corresponds to an entity - a "thing" for which we have a conceptual class
* Predicates are a property of the entity to which they are attached
* Objects are either entities or literal values such as strings or numbers
* Multiple triples can be tied together by using the same subjects and objects in different triples

## 3. Using Semantic Data
-

## 4. Just Enough RDF
### The RDF Data Model
* RDF is a language for expressing data models using statements expressed as triples
* Each statement is composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object

### Resources
* A resource is simply anything that can be identified with a Universal Resource Identifier (URI)

### Blank Nodes
* Blank nodes are graph nodes that represent a subject (or object) for which we would like to make assertions, but have no way to address with a proper URI

### Literal Values
* Can have an optional language (e.g., English, French) and type (e.g., integer, boolean, string, float)

### RDF Serialization Formats
* Four serialization formats:
	* N-Triples
	* N3
	* RDF/XML
	* RDF in attributes (RDFa)

* N3 uses the letter "a" as a predicate representing the RDF "type" relationship
	* tom a foaf:Person

### SPARQL
* SPARQL provides four forms of queries:
	* SELECT
	* CONSTRUCT
	* ASK
	* DESCRIBE

## 5. Sources of Semantic Data
* Degree: Number of nodes connected to a given node
* Betweenness centrality: Centrality is defined as the percentage of shortest paths in the graph that pass through a given node
* Clique: A group of nodes that are all connected to one another. The smallest cliques have only two members (the two connected nodes)
* Clustering: Calculated from the fraction of its neighbors that are connected to one another
* Data models within Freebase are called schemas and are broken down along areas of interest called domains. Domains serve only to collect components of a data model
* In Freebase, any object can have one or more types
* Types provide a basic categorization of objects within Freebase and indicate what properties you might expect to find linked to the object
* A domain is also a namespace, and types have keys in domains (e.g., /people/person -> domain = people, type = person)
* Types operate as namespaces for properties (e.g., /people/person/date_of_birth)
* Every object in Freebase is automatically given the type object (/type/object), which provides properties available to all objects, such as name, id, and type
* The type property (/type/object/type) is used to link the object with type definitions
* In a self-similar fashion, types themselves are nothing more than objects that have a /type/object/type link to the root type object /type/type

## 6. What Do You Mean, "Ontology"?
* Ontologies allow us to express the formal rules for inference
* Classes are used to define the characteristics of a group of things and to specify their relationships to other classes
* Classes describe groups of entities
* The collection of types that use the property is called the domain of the property
* A property definition may also indicate which types of values this property can take on, representing the range of the property
* When a property does not indicate its domain, we cannot infer anything about the resources it is describing, as it may be used by any type of resource
* If the property define a type as its domain, then we can infer that anything described by that property is of the domain type
* If the property defines several types as its domain, we can infer that the resource described by that property is all of the domain types
* If a property does not specify a range, then we can't infer anything about the value of the property
* If the property specifies one or more types as its range, then a value of the property can be inferred to be all of the types specified by the property range
* The process of making a subject-predicate-object statement in a subject is called reification in RDF
* OWL is broken into three sub-languages of increasing complexity and expressiveness
	* OWL-Lite
	* OWL DL
	* OWL Full
* Data modeling is not a singular activity, is it iterative:
	* Build a model
	* Populate some instances
	* Run some queries
	* Repeat

# Entities of interest
* rdf:type: The type of a resource. This property specifies that a resource is an instance of a specific RDFS class
* rdf:XMLLiteral: The class of all XML literal values
* rdfs:domain: Specifies that a property has a domain of a specified class. In a triple, the subject will always be an instance of the class specified by the rdfs:domain property
* rdfs:range: Species that a property as a range of a specified class. In a triple, the object will always be an instance of the class specified by the rdfs:range property
* rdfs:subclassOf: Specifies that a class is a subclass of another class, and therefore that all instances of the subclass are also instances of the superclass
* owl:Thing: All classes implicitly subclass this class
* owl:Class: The class of RDF resources that are classes
* owl:ObjectProperty: Indicate that the linked entity is an object property. The class of all properties that have ranges that are instances of owl:Class
* owl:DatatypeProperty: Indicate that the linked entity is a datatype (intrinsic) property (string, integer, float, character, boolean, date, datetime, etc.). The class of all properties that have ranges that are literals, and instances of rdfs:Datatype
* owl:FunctionalProperty/owl:InverseFunctionalProperty
* owl:inverseOf: Indicates that a property is an inverse of the given property (director directed film vs film directedBy director)
