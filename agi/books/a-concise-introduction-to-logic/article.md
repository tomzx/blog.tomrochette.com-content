# Notes

## 1 Basic Concepts
## 1.1 Arguments, Premises, and Conclusions
* An argument is a group of statements, one or more of which (the premises) are claimed to provide support for, or reasons to believe, one of the others (the conclusion)
* Questions, proposals, suggestions, commands and exclamations cannot be true/false (and so are not usually classified as statements)
* The pattern found in most arguments that lack indicator words: The intended conclusion is stated first, and the remaining statements are then offered in support of this first statement

## 1.2 Recognizing Arguments
* What is needed for a passage to contain an argument:
	* At least one of the statements must claim to present evidence or reasons
	* There must be a claim that the alleged evidence supports or implies something - that is, a claim that something follows from the alleged evidence or reasons

### Simple Noninferential Passages
* Contains statements that could be premises or conclusions (or both), but what is missing is a claim that any potential premise supports a conclusion or that any potential conclusion is supported by premises
* Passages of this sort includes warnings, pieces of advice, statements of belief or opinion, loosely associated statements, and reports

### Expository Passages
* An expository passage is a kind of discourse that begins with a topic sentence followed by one or more sentences that develop the topic sentence. If the objective is not to prove the topic sentence but only to expand it or elaborate it, then there is no argument
* In deciding whether an expository passage should be interpreted as an argument, try to determine whether the purpose of the subsequent sentences in the passage is merely to develop the topic sentence or also to prove that it is true

### Illustrations
* An illustration is an expression involving one or more examples that is intended to show what something means or how it is done
* In deciding whether an illustration should be interpreted as an argument, determine whether the passage merely shows how something is done or what something means, or whether it also purports to prove something

### Explanations
* An explanation is an expression that purports to shed light on some event or phenomenon
* Every explanation is composed of two distinct components: the explanandum and the explanans
	* The explanandum is the statement that describes the event or phenomenon to be explained
	* The explanans is the statement or group of statements that purports to do the explaining
* To distinguish explanations from arguments, identify the statement that is either the explanandum or the conclusion. If this statement describes an accepted matter of fact, and if the remaining statements purport to shed light on this statement, then the passage is an explanation

### Conditional Statements
* A conditional statement is an "if ... then ..." statement
* Every conditional statement is made up of two compoenents statements:
	* The antecedent: The component statement immediately following the "if"
	* The consequent: The component statement following the "then"
* A single conditional statement is not an argument
* A conditional statement may serve as either the premise or the conclusion (or both) of an argument
* The inferential content of a conditional statement may be reexpressed to form an argument

## 1.3 Deduction and Induction
* Briefly we can say that deductive arguments are those that rest on necessary reasoning, while inductive arguments are those that rest on probabilistic reasoning
* A deductive argument is an argument incorporating the claim that it is impossible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true
* An inductive argument is an argument incorporating the claim that it is improbable that the conclusion be false given that the premises are true
* In deciding whether an argument is inductive or deductive, we look to certain objective features of the argument. These features include:
	* the occurence of special indicator words
	* the actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion
	* the form or style of argumentation
* Inductive indicators: probably, improbable, plausible, implausible, likely, unlikely, reasonable to conclude
* Deductive indicators: necessarily, certainly, absolutely, definitely

### Deductive Argument Forms
* Argument based on mathematics
* Argument from definition
* Categorical syllogism
* Hypothetical syllogism
* Disjunctive syllogism
* A syllogism, in general, is an argument consisting of exactly two premises and one conclusion
* A categorical syllogism is a syllogism in which each statement beings with one of the words "all," "no," or "some"
* A hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism having a conditional ("if ... then ...") statement for one or both of its premises
* A disjunctive syllogism is a syllogism having a disjunctive ("either ... or ...") statement

### Inductive Argument Forms
* A prediction is an argument that proceeds from our knowledge of the past to a claim about the future
* Nearly everyone realizes that the future cannot be known with certainty; thus, whenever an argument makes a prediction about the future, one is usually justified in considering the argument inductive
* An argument from analogy is an argument that depends on the existence of an analogy, or similarity, between two things or states of affairs
* A generalization is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a selected sample to some claim about the whole group
* An argument from authority is an argument that concludes something is true because a presumed expert or witness has said that it is
* An argument based on signs is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a sign to a claim about the thing or situation that the sign symbolizes
* A causal inference is an argument that proceeds from knowledge of a cause to a claim about an effect, or, conversely, from knowledge of an effect to a claim about a cause
* There is a tradition extending back to the time of Aristotle that holds that inductive arguments are those that proceed from the particular to the general, while deductive arguments are those that proceed from the general to the particular

## 1.4 Validity, Truth, Soundness, Strength, Cogency
* The evaluation of any argument involves answering two distinct questions:
	* Do the premises support the conclusion?
	* Are all the premises true?

### Deductive Arguments
* A valid deductive argument is an argument in which it is impossible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true
* An invalid deductive argument is a deductive argument in which it is possible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true
* Validity is something that is determined by the relationship between premises and conclusion. The question is not whether the premises and conclusion are true or false, but whether the premises support the conclusion
* Any deductive argument having actually true premises and an actually false conclusion is invalid
* A sound argument is a deductive argument that is valid and has all true premises
* An unsound argument is a deductive argument that is invalid, has one or more false premises, or both

### Inductive Arguments
* A strong inductive argument is an inductive argument in which it is improbable that the conclusion be false given that the premises are true
* A weak inductive argument is an argument in which the conclusion does not follow probably from the premises, even though it is claimed to
* When we speak of the premises being true, we mean "true" in a complete sense. The premises must not exclude or overlook some crucial piece of evidence that undermines the stated premises and requires a different conclusion. This proviso is otherwise called the total evidence requirement
* To be considered strong, an inductive argument must have a conclusion that is more probable than improbable. In other words, given that the premises are true, the likelihood that the conclusion is true must be more than 50 percent, and as the probability increases, the argument becomes stronger
* A cogent argument is an inductive argument that is strong and has all true premises. Also, the premises must be true in the sense of meeting the total evidence requirement
* An uncogent argument is an inductive argument that is weak, has one or more false premises, fails to meet the total evidence requirement, or any combination of these

## 1.5 Argument Forms: Proving Invalidity
* Can basically be summarized as "if the arguments are not transitive, then the conclusion cannot be true"

### Counterexample Method
* It consists of isolating the form of an argument and then constructing a substitution instance having true premises and a false conclusion. This proves the form invalid, which in turn proves the argument invalid
* The counterexample method can be used to prove the invalidity of any invalid argument, but it cannot prove the validity of any valid argument

## 1.6 Extended Arguments
* A set of components to diagram an argument:
	* Vertical pattern
	* Horizontal pattern
	* Conjoint premises
	* Multiple conclusions

## 2 Language: Meaning and Definition
## 2.1 Varieties of Meaning
* Two linguistic functions are particularly important:
	* To convey information
	* To express or evoke feelings
* Terminology that conveys information is said to have cognitive meaning, and terminology that expresses or evokes feelings is said to have emotional meaning
* A value claim is a claim that something is good, bad, right, wrong, better, worse, more important, less important than some other thing
* Two defects of cognitive meaning
	* Vagueness
	* Ambiguity
* A vague expression is one that allows for borderline cases in which it is impossible to tell if the expression applies or does not apply
* An ambiguous expression is one that can be interpreted as having more than one clearly distinct meaning in a given context
* The difference between ambiguity and vaguesness is that vague terminology allows for a relatively continuous range of interpretations, whereas ambiguous terminology allows for multiple discrete interpretations
* Disputes that arise over the meaning of language are called verbal disputes
* In dealing with disputes, the first question is whether the dispute is factual, verbal, or some combination of the two
	* If the dispute is verbal, then the second question to be answered is whether the dispute concerns ambiguity or vagueness

## 2.2 The Intension and Extension of Terms
* The basic units of any ordinary language are words
* A term is any word or arrangement of words that may serve as the subject of a statement (proper names, common names, descriptive phrases)
* The intensional meaning, or intension, consists of the qualities or attributes that the term connotes, and the extensional meaning, or extension, consists of the members of the class that the term denotes
	* Intensional meaning: cats are furry, have four legs, move in a certain way, emit certain sounds
	* Extensional meaning: all the cats in the universe
* Intension <-> sense, Extension <-> reference
* The conventional connotation of a term includes the attributes that the term commonly calls forth in the minds of competent speakers of the language
* Empty extension: denote the empty (or "null") class, the class that has no members
* Intension determines extension

## 2.3 Definitions and Their Purposes
* Definition: a group of words that assigns a meaning to some word or group of words
* Every definition consists of two parts: a definiendum and the definiens
	* The definiendum is the word or group of words that is supposed to be defined
	* The definiens is the word or group of words that does the defining

### Stipulative Definitions
* A stipulative definition assigns a meaning to a word for the first time

### Lexical Definitions
* Used to report the meaning that a word already has in a language
* Have the further purpose of eliminating the ambiguity that would otherwise arise if one of these meanings were to be confused with another

### Precising Definitions
* Reduce the vagueness of a word

### Theoretical Definitions
* Assign a meaning to a word by suggesting a theory that gives a certain characterization to the entities that the term denotes

### Persuasive Definitions
* To engender a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward what is denoted by the definiendum. This purpose is accomplished by assigning an emotionally charged or value-laden meaning to a word while making it appear that the word really has (or ought to have) that meaning in the language in which it is used

## 2.4 Definitional Techniques
### Extensional (Denotative) Definitions
* An extensional (denotative) definition is one that assigns a meaning to a term by indicating the members of the class that the definiendum denotes
* There are at least three ways of indicating the members of a class:
	* pointing to them (demonstrative or ostensive definitions)
	* naming them individually (enumerative definitions)
	* naming them in groups (definitions by subclass)
* The principle that intension determines extension, whereas the converse is not true, underlies the fact that all extensional definitions suffer serious deficiencies (how are the properties used as intension determined?)
* Extensions can suggest intensions, but they cannot determine them

### Intensional (Connotative) Definitions
* An intensional definition is one that assigns a meaning to a word by indicating the qualities or attributes that the word connotes
* There are at least four kinds of intensional definitions:
	* synonymous definition: the definiens is a single word that connotes the same attributes as the definiendum
	* etymological definition: assigns a meaning to a word by disclosing the word's ancestry in both its own language and other languages
	* operational definition: assigns a meaning to a word by specifying certain experimental procedures that determine whether or not the word applies to a certain thing
	* definition by genus and difference: assigns a meaning to a term by identifying a genus term and one or more difference words that, when combined, convey the meaning of the term being defined
* In logic, genus simply means a relatively larger class, and species means a relatively smaller subclass of the genus

## 2.5 Criteria for Lexical Definitions
* A lexical definition should ...
	* Rule 1: ... conform to the standards of proper grammar
	* Rule 2: ... convey the essential meaning of the word being defined
	* Rule 3: ... be neither too broad nor too narrow
	* Rule 4: ... avoid circularity
	* Rule 5: ... not be negative when it can be affirmative
	* Rule 6: ... avoid figurative, obscure, vague, or ambiguous language
	* Rule 7: ... avoid affective terminology
	* Rule 8: ... indicate the context to which the definiens pertains

## 3 Informal Fallacies
## 3.1 Fallacies in General
* A fallacy is a defect in an argument that arises from either a mistake in reasoning or the creation of an illusion that makes a bad argument appear good
* non sequitur ("it does not follow")
* Fallacies are usually divided into two groups: formal and informal
* A formal fallacy is one that may be identified merely by examining the form or structure of an argument. They are found only in deductive arguments that have identifiable forms (categorical syllogisms, disjunctive syllogisms, hypothetical syllogisms)
* Informal fallacies are those that can be detected only by examining the content of the argument

## 3.2 Fallacies of Relevance
* The connection between premises and conclusion is emotional
* Appeal to force: Whenever an arguer poses a conclusion to another person and tells that person either implicitly or explicitly that some harm will come to him or her if he or she does not accept the conclusion
* Appeal to pity: When an arguer attempts to support a conclusion by merely evoking pity from the reader or listener
* Appeal to the people:
	* Direct approach: When an arguer, addressing a large group of people, excites the emotions and enthusiasm of the crowd to win acceptance for his or her conclusion
		* Appeal to fear: When an arguer trumps up a fear of something in the mind of the crowd and then uses that fear as a premise for some conclusion
	* Indirect approach: The arguer aims his or her appeal not at the crowd as a whole but at one or more individual separately, focusing on some aspect of those individuals' relationship to the crowd
		* Bandwagon argument: Everybody believes such-and-such or does such-and-such; therefore, you should believe or do such-and-such, too
		* Appeal to vanity: Involves linking the love, admiration, or approval of the crowd with some famous figure who is loved, admired, or approved of
		* Appeal to snobbery: The arguer appeals to a smaller group of the crowd that is supposed to be superior in some way. If the listener wants to be part of this group, then he or she will do a certain thing, think in a certain way, or buy a certain product
		* Appeal to tradition: When an arguer cites the fact that something has become a tradition as grounds for some conclusion
* Argument against the person (argumentum ad hominem): Involves two arguers. One of them advances a certain argument, and the other then responds by directing his or her attention not to the first person's argument but to the first person himself
	* 3 forms:
		* Ad hominem abusive: The second person responsd to the first person's argument by verbally abusing the first person
		* Ad hominem circumstantial: The respondent attempts to discredit the opponent's argument by alluding to certain circumstances that affect the opponent
		* Tu quoque: The second arguer attempts to make the first appear to be hypocritical or arguing in bad faith
* Accident: When a general rule is applied to a specific case it was not intended to cover
* Straw man: When an arguer distorts an opponent's argument for the purpose of more easily attacking it, demolishes the distorted argument, and then concludes that the opponent's real argument has been demolished
* Missing the point (ignoratio elenchi): When the premises of an argument support one particular conclusion, but then a different conclusion, often vaguely related to the correct conclusion, is drawn
* Red herring: When the arguer diverts the attention of the reader or listener by changing the subject to a different but sometimes subtly related one. He or she then finishes by either drawing a conclusion about this different issue or by merely presuming that some conclusion has been established

## 3.3 Fallacies of Weak Induction
* The fallacies of weak induction occur because the connection between premises and conclusion is not strong enough to support the conclusion
* Appeal to unqualified authority (argumentum ad verecundiaum): When the cited authority or witness lacks credibility
	* In deciding whether a person is a qualified authority, one should keep two important points in mind. First, the person might be an authority in more than one field. Second, there are some areas in which pratically no one can be considered an authority
* Appeal to ignorance (argumentum ad ignorantiam): When the premises of an argument state that nothing has been proved one way or the other about something, and the conclusion makes a definite assertion about that thing
	* Two important exceptions:
		* If qualified researchers investigate a certain phenomenon within their range of expertise and fail to turn up any evidence that the phenomenon exists, this fruitless search by itself constitutes positive evidence about the question
		* In the United States and a few other countries, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty
* Hasty generalization (converse accident): When there is a reasonable likelihood that the sample is not representative of the group
* False cause: Whenever the link between premises and conclusion depends on some imagined causal connection that probably does not exist
	Post hoc ergo propter hoc ("after this, therefore on account of this"): Presupposes that just because one event precedes another event, the first event causes the second
	Non causa pro causa ("not the cause for the cause"): When what is taken to be the cause of something is not really the cause at all and the mistake is based on something other than mere temporal succession
	Oversimplified cause: When a multitude of causes is responsible for a certain effect but the arguer selects just one of these causes and represents it as if it were the sole cause
	Gambler's fallacy: Whenever the conclusion of an argument depends on the supposition that independent events in a game of chance are causally related
* Slippery slope: When the conclusion of an argument rests on an alleged chain reaction and there is not sufficient reason to think that the chain reaction will actually take place
* Weak analogy: An argument in which the conclusion depends on the existence of an analogy, or similarity, between two things or situations. The fallacy of weak analogy is committed when the analogy is not strong enough to support the conclusion that is drawn

## 3.4 Fallacies of Presumption, Ambiguity, and Illicit Transference
* Begging the question (petitio principii): Whenever the arguer creates the illusion that inadequate premises provide adequate support for the conclusion by leaving out a possibly false (shaky) key premise, by restating a possibly false premise as the conclusion, or by reasoning in a circle
* Complex question: When two (or more) questions are asked in the guise of a single question and a single answer is then given to both of them
* False dichotomy: When a disjunctive premise presents two unlikely alternatives as if they were the only ones available, and the arguer then eliminates the undesirable alternative, leaving the desirable one as the conclusion
* Suppressed evidence: When an inductive argument ignore important piece of evidence that outweighs the presented evidence and entails a very different conclusion
* Equivocation: When the conclusion of an argument depends on the fact that a word or phrase is used, either explicitly or implicitly, in two different senses in the argument
* Amphiboly: When the arguer misinterprets an ambiguous statement and then draws a conclusion based on this faulty interpretation
	* Amphiboly differs from equivocation in two important ways:
		* Equivocation is always traced to an ambiguity in the meaning of a word or phrase, whereas amphiboly involves a syntatical ambiguity in a statement
		* Amphiboly usually involves a mistake made by the arguer in interpreting an ambiguous statement made by someone else, whereas the ambiguity in equivocation is typically the arguer's own creation
* Composition: When the conclusion of an argument depends on the erroneous transference of an attribute from the parts of something onto the whole
	* To distinguish composition from hasty generalization, the following procedure should be followed:
		* Examine the conclusion of the argument
			* If the conclusion is a general statement, the fallacy committed is hasty generalization
			* If the conclusion is a class statement, the fallacy is composition
* Division: When the conclusion of an argument depends on the erroneous transference of an attribute from a whole (or a class) onto its parts (or members)
	* If the premises contain a general statement, the fallacy committed is accident
	* If the premises contain a class statement, the fallacy is division

## 3.5 Fallacies in Ordinary Language
### Avoiding Fallacies
* We can identify three factors that lead to most of the informal mistakes in reasoning
	* Intent. Many fallacies are committed intentionally. The arguer may know full well that his or her reasoning is defective but goes ahead with it anyway because of some benefit for himself or herself or some other person
	* Careless mental posture combined with an emotional disposition favoring or opposing some person or thing
	* The influence of what we might call the "worldview" of the arguer

## 4 Categorical Propositions
## 4.1 The Components of Categorical Propositions
* A proposition that relates two classes, or categories, is called a categorical proposition
* The classes in question are denoted respectively by the subject term and the predicate term
* The proposition asserts that either all or part of the class denoted by the subject term is included in or excluded from the class denoted by the predicate term
* Standard-form categorical proposition
	* All S are P
	* No S are P
	* Some S are P
	* Some S are not P
* "All S are not P" is not a standard form. This form is ambiguous and can be rendered as either "No S are P" or "Some S are P"
* There are exactly three forms of quantifiers ("all", "no", "some") and two forms of copulas ("are" and "are not")
* The quality of a categorical proposition is either affirmative or negative
* The quantity of a categorical proposition is either universal or particular
* Categorical propositions have commonly been designated by letter names corresponding to the first four vowels of the Roman alphabet:
	* A: universal affirmative
	* E: universal negative
	* I: particular affirmative
	* O: particular negative
* A term is said to be distributed if the proposition makes an assertion about every member of the class denoted by the term
	* A: the subject term is distributed
	* E: Both terms are distributed
	* I: No term is distributed
	* O: The predicate is distributed

## 4.2 Venn Diagrams and the Modern Square of Opposition
* Aristotle held that universal propositions about existing things have existential import
* According to the theory developed by George Boole, no universal propositions have existential import
* For both, the word "some" implies existence
* From a boolean standpoint:
	* All S are P = No members of S are outside P
	* No S are P = No members of S are inside P
	* Some S are P = At least one S exist that is a P
	* Some S are not P = at least one S exist that is not a P
* A and O make assertions that are the exact opposite of each other
* E and I make assertions that are the exact opposite of each other
* This relationship of mutually contradictory pairs of propositions is represented in a diagram called the modern square of opposition
* Propositions are said to be vacuously true, because their truth value results solely from the fact that the subject class is empty, or void of members
* Arguments that have only one premise are called immediate inferences
* Arguments that are valid from the Boolean standpoint are said to be unconditionally valid because they are valid regardless of whether their terms refer to existing things

## 4.4 Conversion, Obversion, and Contraposition
### Conversion
* A conversion consists of switching the subject term with the predicate term
* E.g. No F are H -> No H are F
* Two statements are said to be logically equivalent statements when they necessarily have the same truth value
* Converting an E or I statement gives a new statement that always has the same truth value (and the same meaning) as the given statement
* Converted an A or O statement gives a new statement whose truth value is logically undetermined in relation to the given statement
* The fallacy of illicit conversion: Converting an A or O statement and assuming they are logically equivalent statements

### Obversion
* Obversion requires two steps:
	* Changing the quality
	* Replacing the predicate with its term complement
* E.g. No S are P -> All S are non-P
* The term complement is the word or group of words that denotes the class complement
* Obversion of all type of statements (A, E, I, O) are logically equivalent to their original statement

### Contraposition
* Contraposition requires two steps:
	* Switching the subject and predicate terms
	* Replacing the subject and predicate terms with their term complements
* E.g. All G are A -> All non-A are non-G
* Contrapositive of A and O statements are logically equivalent to their original statement
* Contrapositive of E and I statements are logically undetermined in relation to the given statement
* The fallacy of illicit contraposition: Assuming that the contraposition of an E or I statement is logically equivalent to the given statement

## 4.5 The Traditional Square of Opposition
* The traditional square of opposition is an arrangement of lines that illustrates logically necessary relations among the four kinds of categorical propositions
* Contradictory: opposite truth value
* Contrary: at least one is false (not both true)
* Subcontrary: at least one is true (not both false)
* Subalternation: truth flows downward, falsity flows upward
* Contrary relation: If a certain A proposition is given as true, the corresponding E proposition is false, and if an E proposition is given as true, the corresponding A proposition is false. But if an A proposition is given as false, the corresponding E proposition could be either true or false. Similarly, if an E proposition is given as false, the corresponding A proposition has logically undetermined truth value
* Subcontrary relation: If a certain I proposition is given as false, the corresponding O proposition is true, and if an O proposition is given as false, the corresponding I proposition is true. But if either an I or O proposition is given as true, then the corresponding proposition could be either true or false
* Subalternation relation: If an A proposition is given as true, the corresponding I proposition is true also, and if an I proposition is given as false, the corresponding A proposition is false. But if an A proposition is given as false, this truth value cannot be transmitted downward, so the corresponding I proposition will have logically undetermined truth value. Conversely, if an I proposition is given as true, this truth value cannot be transmitted upward, so the corresponding A proposition will have logically undetermined truth value. Analogous reasoning prevails for the subalternation relation between the E and O propositions
* Inferences that depends on an incorrect application of the (contrary, subcontrary, subalternation) relation commit the formal fallacy of illicit (contrary, subcontrary, subalternation)
* What happens when the Aristotelian standpoint is adopted but the propositions are about things that do not exist? The answer is that under these conditions the traditional square gives exactly the same results as the modern square
	* Inferences that are based on a correct application of the contradictory relation are valid, but inferences that are based on an otherwise correct application of the other three relations are invalid and commit the existential fallacy
* Conditionally valid applies to an argument after the Aristotelian standpoint has been adopted and we are not certain if the subject term of the premise denotes actually existing things

## 4.6 Venn Diagrams and the Traditional Standpoint
* The steps involved in testing an immediate inference from the Aristotelian standpoint
	* Reduce the inference to its form and test it from the Boolean standpoint. If the form is valid, proceed no further. The inference is valid from both standpoints
	* If the inference form is invalid from the Boolean standpoint and has a particular conclusion, then adopt the Aristotelian standpoint and look to see if the left-hand premise circle is partly shaded. If it is, enter a circled X in the unshaded part and retest the form
	* If the inference form is conditionally valid, determine if the circled X represents something that exists. If it does, the condition is fulfilled, and the inference is valid from the Aristotelian standpoint. If it does not, the inference is invalid, and it commits the existential fallacy from the Aristotelian standpoint

## 5 Categorical Syllogisms
## 5.1 Standard Form, Mood, and Figure
* A syllogism is a deductive argument consisting of two premises and one conclusion
* The major term is the predicate of the conclusion
* The minor term is the subject of the conclusion
* The middle term is the one that occurs once in each premise and does not occur in the conclusion
* The major premise is the one that contains the major term
* The minor premise is the one that contains the minor term
* A standard-form categorical syllogism is one that meets the following four conditions:
	1. All three statements are standard-form categorical propositions
	2. The two occurrences of each term are identical
	3. Each term is used in the same sense throughout the argument
	4. The major premise is listed first, the minor premise second, and the conclusion last
* A categorical syllogism is a deductive argument consisting of three categorical propositions that is capable of being translated into standard form
* The mood of a categorical syllogism consists of the letter names of the proposition that make it up (major A, minor O, conclusion E -> AOE)
* The figure of a categorical syllogism is determined by the location of the two occurrences of the middle term in the premises (position of the middle terms: 1 \\, 2 X|, 3 |X, 4 /)

## 5.2 Venn Diagrams
* The critical term is the term in a categorical syllogism which, when it denotes at least one existing thing, guarantees that the subject of the conclusion denotes at least one existing thing
* Apply the universal premise first, then the particular premise

## 5.3 Rules and Fallacies
### Boolean Standpoint
* Rule 1: The middle term must be distributed at least once
	* Fallacy: Undistributed middle
* Rule 2: If a term is distributed in the conclusion, then it must be distributed in a premise
	* Fallacy: Illicit major; illicit minor
* Rule 3: Two Negative premises are not allowed
	* Fallacy: Exclusive premises
* Rule 4: A negative premise requires a negative conclusion, and a negative conclusion requires a negative premise
	* Fallacy: Drawing an affirmative conclusion from a negative premise or drawing a negative conclusion from affirmative premises
* It turns out that no valid syllogism can have two particular premises
* Rule 5: If both premises are universal, the conclusion cannot be particular
	* Fallacy: Existential fallacy

### Aristotelian Standpoint
* Any categorical syllogism that breaks one of the first four rules is invalid from the Aristotelian standpoint
* The critical term is the one that is superfluously distributed. In other words, it is the term that, in the premises, is distributed in more occurrences than is necessary for the syllogism to obey the first two rules
