## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Can we devise universal cognitive tests?
* Can we have a formal definition of intelligence solely based on computational principles?
* How do you evaluate a human-machine hybrid?

# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Extended Nature
### 1.1 Face the diversity
* Several groups
  * Computers
  * Cognitively enhanced organisms
  * Biologically enhanced computers
  * (Hybrid) collectives
  * Minimal or rare cognition

### 1.2 The machine kingdom
* No matter how wild and diverse life may be, it is constrained by the rules of evolution and natural selection
* The machine kingdom is the set of all interactive systems taking inputs and producing outputs, possibly asynchronously, through interfaces, bodies, sensors and actuators, etc.
* The physical Church-Turing thesis: every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means
* The same algorithm running in a faster computer is, in terms of the machine kingdom, a different machine
* we will generically refer to the elements of the machine kingdom as agents or subjects, especially when confronted with an environment, a task or a test
* Our fixation on the behaviour of all interactive systems derives from our interest in the measurement of what systems do
* Our goal is to measure and classify them (machines) in terms of their behavioral features. This is what we call universal psychometrics
* Universal psychometrics is the analysis and development of measurement tools for the evaluation of behavioural features in the machine kingdom, including cognitive abilities and personality traits
