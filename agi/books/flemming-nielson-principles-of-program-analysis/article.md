# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Introduction
## 1.1 The Nature of Program Analysis
* One common theme behind all approaches to program analysis is that in order to remain computable (tractable?) one can only provide approximate answers
* In general, we expect the program analysis to produce a possibly larger set of possibilities than what will ever happen during execution of the program
* All program analyses should be semantics based: this means that the information obtained from the analysis can be proved to be safe (or correct) with respect to a semantics of the programming language
* Program analysis should not be semantics direct: this would mean that the structure of the program analysis should reflect the structure of the semantics

## 1.2 Setting the Scene
## Reaching Definitions Analysis
* An assignment (called a definition in the classical literature) of the form $[x := a]^\ell$ may reach a certain program point (typically the entry or exit of an elementary block) if there is an execution of the program where $x$ was last assigned a value at $\ell$ when the program point is reached

## Chapter 2 - Data Flow Analysis
* Classical data flow analyses:
	* Available expressions
	* Reaching definitions
	* Very busy expressions
	* Live variables

## 2.1 Intraprocedural Analysis
### Initial and final labels
* $init: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow Lab}$
	* Returns the initial label of a statement
* $final: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Lab)}$
	* Returns the set of final labels in a statement

### Blocks
* $blocks: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow  \mathcal{P}(Blocks)}$
	* Blocks is the set of statements, or elementary blocks
* $labels: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow  \mathcal{P}(Lab)}$
	* The set of labels occurring in a program
* $init(S) \in labels(S)$ and $final(S) \subseteq labels(S)$

### Flows and reverse flows
* $flow: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Lab \times Lab)}$
	* The set of couples representing transitions between labels
* $flow^R: \bf{Stmt \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Lab \times Lab)}$
	* The reverse flow
	* $flow^R(S): \{(\ell,\ell') | (\ell',\ell) \in flow(S)\}$

### The program of interest
* $S_*$: the program that we are analysing
* $\bf{Lab_*}$: the labels ($labels(S_*)$) appearing in $S_*$
* $\bf{Var_*}$: the variables ($FV(S_*)$) appearing in $S_*$
* $\bf{Blocks_*}$: the elementary blocks ($blocks(S_*)$) occurring in $S_*$
* $\bf{AExp_*}$: the set of non-trivial arithmetic subexpressions in $S_*$. An expression is trivial if it is a single variable or constant

## 2.1.1 Available Expressions Analysis
* For each program point, which expressions must have already been computed, and not later modified, on all paths to the program point
* An expression is killed in a block if any of the variables used in the expression are modified in the block
* A generated expression is an expression that is evaluated in the block and where none of the variables used in the expression are later modified in the block
* We are interested in the largest sets satisfying the equation for $AE_{entry}$

## 2.1.2 Reaching Definitions Analysis
* For each program point, which assigments may have been made and not overwritten, when program execution reaches this point along some path
* An assignment is destroyed if the block assigns a new value to the variable
* We are interested in the smallest sets satisfying the equation for $RD_{entry}$

## 2.1.3 Very Busy Expressions Analysis
* An expression is very busy at the exit from a label if, no matter what path is taken from the label, the expression must always be used before any of the variables occurring in it are redefined
* (The aim of the Very Busy Expressions Analysis is to determine) For each program point, which expressions must be very busy at the exit from the point
* We are interested in the largest sets satisfying the equation for $VB_{exit}$

## 2.1.4 Live Variables Analysis
* A variable is live at the exit from a label if there exists a path from the label to a use of the variable that does not re-define the variable
* (The Live Variables Analysis will determine) For each program point, which variables may be live at the exit from the point
* This analysis might be used as the basis for Dead Code Elimination
* We are interested in the smallest sets satisfying the equation for $LV_{exit}$

## 2.1.5 Derived Data Flow Information
* Use-Definition chains or ud-chains: Links that, for each use of a variable, associate all assignments that reach that use
* Definition-Use chains or du-chains: Links that, for each assignment, associate all uses
* One application of ud- and du-chains is for Dead Code Elimination
* Another application is in Code Motion (moving code around)

## 2.6 Shape Analysis
* Shape Analysis will allow us to statically detect errors like deferencing a nil-pointer
