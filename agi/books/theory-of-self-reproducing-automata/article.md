## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Higher class type implies it can describe a subset of the lower class type? For example, a program description (higher level) describing potential programs (lower level)

# Overview
* The idea that communication between different systems is done through the translation of their respective language into the target's language (for example, from the sender's central nervous system language to the sender's language (English) to the receiver's language (English) and finally into the receiver's language central nervous system language)
	* Is the sender's CNS language different from his english language?
* The idea that digital computers are used to perform computations of exceedingly great logical depth (while it would be the opposite for natural automata) seems to imply that we should look for ANN architectures that are more parallel and less deep
* When faced with a very difficult problem, it is difficult to even define what the difficulties are

# Notes
* (p14) A problem of any considerable complexity is composed of many subproblems, and flow diagrams and subroutines can be prepared for these in advance
* (p15) Thus the nervous system appears to be using a radically different system of notation from the ones we are familiar with in ordinary arithmetics and mathematics...
... whatever language the central nervous system is using, it is characterized by less logical and arithmetical depth than what we are normally used to.
Thus logics and mathematics in the central nervous system, when viewed as languages, must be structurally essentially different from those languages to which our common experience refers.
... when we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language, built on the primary language truly used by the central nervous system
* (p19) Two basic questions of automata theory:
	* How can reliable systems be constructed from unreliable components?
	* What kind of logical organization is sufficient for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?
* (p20) Three fundamental factors limiting the engineer's ability to build really powerful computers:
	* The size of the available components
	* The reliability of these components
	* A lack of a theory of the logical organization of complicated systems of computing elements
* (p22) Natural automata are more parallel in operation, digital computers more serial
* (p22) Von Neumann calculated the thermodynamical minimum of energy that must be dissipated by a computing element and concluded that in theory computing elements could be of the order of $10^10$ times more efficient in the use of energy than neurons
* (p23) Von Neumann thought that below a certain level, complexity is degenerative, and self-reproduction is impossible. He suggested that, generally speaking, in the case of simple automata a symbolic description of the behavior of an automaton is simpler than the automaton itself, but that in the case of exceedingly complex automata the automaton is simpler than a symbolic description of its behavior
* (p24) Pulses circulating in neuron cycles, the change of neural thresholds with use, the organization of the nervous system, and the coding of the genes together constitute such a (memory) hierarchy (similar to a digital computer memory hierarchy)
* (p25) Von Neumann thought that automata mathematics should be closer to the continuous (mathematics) and should draw heavily on analysis. He thought that the specific problems of automata theory require this, and he felt that there is a general advantage in an analytical as opposed to a combinatorial approach in mathematics
* (p26) Von Neumann wanted a probabilistic logic which would handle component malfunction as an essential and integral part of automata operation
* (p28) Von Neumann found an analog of thermodynamic degeneration in the theory of self-reproducing automata: below a certain minimum level, complexity and degree of organization are degenerative, but above that level they are not degenerative and may even increase.
* (p28) The efficiency of a computer depends on the proper balance of its different parts with respect to speed and size
* (p28) Von Neumann thought that the mathematics of automata theory should start with mathematical logic and move toward analysis, probability theory, and thermodynamics
* (p32) Of all automata of high complexity, computing machines are the ones which we have the best chance of understanding. In the case of computing machines the complications can be very high, and yet they pertain to an object which is primarily mathematical and which we understand better than we understand most natural objects
* (p38) The reason for using a fast computing machine is not that you want to produce a lot of information. After all, the mere fact that you want some information means that you somehow imagine that you can absorb it, and, therefore, wherever there may be bottlenecks in the automatic arrangement which produces and processes this information, there is a worse bottleneck at the human intellect into which the information ultimately seeps
* (p39) All these automata really consist of two important parts: the general switching part (an active part which affects the logical operations the automaton is supposed to perform), and the memory (which stores information, chiefly intermediate results which are needed for a while and are then discarded and replaced by others)
* (p41) There is one very important thing we do not know: whether nature has ever been subject to this handicap (the use of memory to store temporary computation), or whether natural organisms involve some much better memory device
* (p41) In any fast machine the memory you need is characterized by two data:
	* the capacity
	* the access time
* (p44) McCulloch and Pitts wanted to axiomatize an idealized neuron, which is much simpler than the real one. They believed that the extremely amputated, simplified, idealized object which they axiomatized possessed the essential traits of the neuron, and that all else are incidental complications, which in a first analysis are better forgotten
* (p44) A formal neuron is symbolically designated by a circle, which symbolizes the body of the neuron, and a line branching out from the circle, which symbolizes the axon of the neuron. A neuron has two states: it's excited or not
* (p45) No matter how you formulate your conditions, you can always put a neural network in the box which will realize these conditions, which means that the generality of neural systems is exactly the same as the generality of logics
* (p47) Using the figures we have, which are not very good, but which are probably all right for an orientation, we conclude that apparently a network of about 2 billion relays does nothing but determine how to organize a visual picture
* (p47) There is a good deal in formal logics to indicate that the description of the functions of an automaton is simpler than the automaton itself, as long as the automaton is not very complicated, but that when you get to high complications, the actual object is simpler than the literary description
