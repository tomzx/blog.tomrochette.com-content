# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Introduction and Preview
* Information theory answers two fundamental questions in communication theory:
	* What is the ultimate data compression (answer: the entropy $H$)
	* What is the ultimate transmission rate of communication (answer: the channel capacity $C$)
* The complexity of a string of data can be defined by the length of the shortest binary computer program for computing the string
* We consider Kolmogorov complexity to be more fundamental than Shannon entropy
* One can think about computational complexity (time complexity) and Kolmogorov complexity (program length or descriptive complexity) as two axes corresponding to program running time and program length. Kolmogorov complexity focuses on minimizing along the second axis, and computational complexity focuses on minimizing along the first axis

### 1.1 Preview of the Book
* The entropy of a random variable X with a probability mass function p(x) is defined by
$$
H(X) = - \sum_x p(x)\log_2 p(x)
$$
* Logarithm base 2, measures the entropy in bits
* The entropy is a measure of the average uncertainty in the random variable
* It is the number of bits on average required to describe the random variable
* We can define conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$, which is the entropy of a random variable conditional on the knowledge of another random variable. The reduction in uncertainty due to another random variable is called the mutual information
* For two random variables X and Y this reduction the mutual information
$$
I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x, y)\log \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)}
$$
* A communication channel is a system in which the output depends probabilistically on its input. It is characterized by a probability transition matrix $p(y|x)$ that determines the conditional distribution of the output given the input. For a communication channel with input $X$ and output $Y$, we can define the capacity $C$ by
$$
C = \max_{p(x)} I(X; Y)
$$

## Chapter 2 - Entropy, Relative Entropy and Mutual Information
### 2.1 Entropy
* Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with alphabet $\mathcal{X}$ and probability mass function $p(x) = \Pr\{X = x\}, x \in \mathcal{X}$
* The entropy $H(X)$ of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined by
$$
H(X) = - \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log p(x)
$$
* Some of the basic properties of entropy
	* It is a concave function of the distribution
	* Equals 0 when p = 0 or 1

### 2.2 Joint Entropy and Conditional Entropy
* The joint entropy $H(X, Y)$ of a pair of discrete random variable $(X, Y)$ with a joint distribution $p(x, y)$ is defined as
$$
H(X, Y) = - \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} p(x, y) \log p(x, y)
$$
which can also be expressed as
$$
H(X, Y) = -E \log p(X, Y)
$$
* If $(X, Y) \sim p(x, y)$, the conditional entropy $H(Y|X) is
$$
H(Y|X) = -E \log p(Y|X)
$$
$$
H(X, Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)
$$
$$
\log p(X, Y) = \log p(X) + \log p(Y|X)
$$
$$
H(X, Y|Z) = H(X|Z) + H(Y|X, Z)
$$

### 2.3 Relative Entropy and Mutual Information
* The relative entropy is a measure of the distance between two distributions
* The relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler distance between two probability mass functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ is defined as
$$
\begin{split}
D(p||q) &= \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \\
&= E_p \log \frac{p(X)}{q(X)}
\end{split}
$$
* Mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another random variable
* It is the reduction in the uncertainty of one random variable due to the knowledge of the other
* Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with a joint probability mass function $p(x, y)$ and marginal probability mass function $p(x)$ and $p(y)$. The mutual information $I(X; Y)$ is the relative entropy between the joint distribution and the production distribution $p(x)p(y)$
$$
\begin{split}
I(X; Y) &= \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} p(x, y) \log \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)} \\
&= D(p(x, y)||p(x)p(y)) \\
&= E_{p(x, y)} \log \frac{p(X, Y)}{p(X)p(Y)}
\end{split}
$$

### 2.4 Relationship Between Entropy and Mutual Information
* We can rewrite the definition of mutual information $I(X; Y)$ as
$$
I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)
$$
* Thus, the mutual information $I(X; Y)$ is the reduction in the uncertainty of $X$ due to the knowledge of $Y$
* By symmetry, it also follows that
$$
I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
$$
$$
I(X; Y) = I(Y; X)
$$
* Since $H(X, Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)$
$$
I(X; Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X, Y)
$$
$$
I(X; X) = H(X) - H(X|X) = H(X)
$$
* Thus, the mutual information of a random variable with itself is the entropy of the random variable

### 2.5 Chain Rules For Entropy, Relative Entropy, and Mutual Information
* Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be drawn according to $p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$. Then
$$
H(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n H(X_i|X_{i-1}, \dots, X_1)
$$
* The conditional mutual information of random variables $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$ is defined by
$$
\begin{split}
I(X; Y|Z) &= H(X|Z) - H(X|Y, Z) \\
&= E_{p(x, y, z)} \log \frac{p(X, Y|Z)}{p(X|Z)p(Y|Z)}
\end{split}
$$
$$
I(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n; Y) = \sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i; Y|X_{i-1}, X_{i-2}, \dots, X_1)
$$
$$
D(p(x, y)||q(x, y)) = D(p(x)||q(x)) + D(p(y|x)||q(y|x))
$$

### 2.6 Jensen's Inequality and its Consequences
* A function $f(x)$ is said to be convex over an interval $(a, b)$ if for every $x_1, x_2 \in (a, b)$ and $0 \le \lambda \le 1$
$$
f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda)x_2) \le \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2)
$$
* A function is said to be strictly convex if equality holds only if $\lambda = 0$ or $\lambda = 1$
* A function $f$ is concave if $-f$ is convex
* If the function $f$ has a second derivative that is non-negative (positive) over an interval, the function is convex (stricly convex) over that interval
* (Jensen's inequality) If $f$ is a convex function and $X$ is a random variable
$$
Ef(X) \ge f(EX)
$$
* Moreover, if $f$ is strictly convex, the equality implies that $X = EX$ with probability 1
* (Information inequality) Let $p(x)$, $q(x)$, $x \in \mathcal{X}$, be two probability mass functions. Then
$$
D(p||q) \ge 0
$$
with equality if and only if $p(x) = q(x)$ for all $x$
* (Nonnegativity of mutual information) For any two random variables, $X$, $Y$,
$$
I(X; Y) \ge 0
$$
with equality if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are independent
$$
D(p(y|x)||q(y|x)) \ge 0
$$
with equality if and only if $p(y|x) = q(y|x)$ for all $y$ and $x$ such that $p(x) > 0$
$$
I(X; Y|Z) \ge 0
$$
with equality if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given Z
* (Conditioning reduces entropy)(Information can't hurt)
$$
H(X|Y) \le H(X)
$$
with equality if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are independent

### 2.8 Data-Processing Inequality
* The data processing inequality can be used to show that no clever manipulation of the data can improve the inferences that can be made from the data
* Random variables $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are said to form a Markov chain in that order (denoted $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$) if the conditional distribution of $Z$ depends only on $Y$ and is conditionally independent of $X$. Specifically, $X$, $Y$, $Z$ form a Markov chain $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ if the joint probability mass function can be written as
$$
p(x, y, z) = p(x)p(y|x)p(z|y)
$$
* Some simple consequences are as follows:
	* $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ if and only if $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent given $Y$
	* $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ implies that $Z \rightarrow Y \rightarrow X$
	* If $Z = f(Y)$, then $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$
* If $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$, then $I(X; Y) \ge I(X; Z)$
* If $Z = g(Y)$, we have $I(X; Y) \ge I(X; g(Y))$
	* Thus functions of the data Y cannot increase the information about X

### 2.9 Sufficient Statistics
* A function $T(X)$ is said to be a sufficient statistic relative to the family $\{f_\theta(x)\}$ if $X$ is independent of $\theta$ given $T(X)$ for any distribution on $\theta$
* A statistic $T(X)$ is a minimal sufficient statistic relative to $\{f_\theta(x)\}$ if it is a function of every other sufficient statistic $U$
	* A minimal sufficient statistic maximally compresses the information about $\theta$ in the sample
	* Other sufficient statistics may contain additional irrelevant information

### 2.10 Fano's Inequality
* Let $P_e = \Pr\{\hat{X}(Y) \ne X\}$. Then
$$
H(P_e) + P_e \log |\mathcal{X}| \ge H(X|Y)
$$
* If $X$ and $X'$ are independent and identically distributed, then
$$
\Pr(X = X') \ge 2^{-H(X)}
$$

## Chapter 4 - Entropy Rates of a Stochastic Process
### 4.1 Markov Chains
* A stochastic process is said to be stationary if the joint distribution of any subset of the sequence of random variables is invariant with respect to shifts in the time index; that is
$$
\Pr\{X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \dots, X_n = x_n\} = \Pr\{X_{1+l} = x_1, X_{2+l} = x_2, \dots X_{n+l} = x_n\}
$$
for every $n$ and every shift $l$ and for all $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in \mathcal{X}$
* A discrete stochastic process $X_1, X_2, \dots$ is said to be a Markov chain or a Markov process if for $n = 1, 2, \dots$
$$
\Pr(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1} | X_n = x_n, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, \dots, X_1 = x_1) = \Pr(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1} | X_n = x_n)
$$
for all $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, x_{n+1} \in \mathcal{X}$
* The Markov chain is said to be time invariant if the conditional probability $p(x_{n+1}|x_n)$ does not depend on $n$; that is, for $n = 1, 2, \dots$
$$
\Pr\{X_{n+1} = b | X_n = a\} = \Pr\{X_2 = b | X_1 = a\}
$$
for all $a, b \in \mathcal{X}$

### 4.2 Entropy Rate
* The entropy of a stochastic process $\{X_i\}$ is defined by
$$
H(\mathcal{X}) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)
$$
when the limit exists
$$
H'(\mathcal{X}) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} H(X_n | X_{n-1}, X_{n-2}, \dots, X_1)
$$
* For a stationary stochastic process, the limits exists and are equal:
$$
H(\mathcal{X}) = H'(\mathcal{X})
$$
$H'(\mathcal{X})$ is the conditional entropy on the last random variable given the past

### 4.3 Example: Entropy Rate of a Random Walk on a Weighted Graph
* It is easy to see that a stationary random walk on a graph is time-reversible; that is, the probability of any sequence of states is the same forward or backward
$$
\Pr(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \dots, X_n = x_n) = \Pr(X_n = x_1, X_{n-1} = x_2, \dots, X_1 = x_n)
$$
* Any time-reversible Markov chain can be represented as a random walk on an undirected weighted graph

## Chapter 5 - Data Compression
### 5.1 Examples of Codes
* A source code $C$ for a random variable $X$ is a mapping from $\mathcal{X}$, the range of $X$, to $\mathcal{D}^*$, the set of finite-length strings of symbols from a $D$-ary alphabet. Let $C(x)$ denote the codeword corresponding to $x$ and let $l(x)$ denote the length of $C(x)$
* The expected length $L(C)$ of a source code $C(x)$ for a random variable $X$ with probability mass function $p(x)$ is given by
$$
L(C) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)l(x)
$$
* A code is said to be nonsingular if every element of the range of $X$ maps into a different string in $\mathcal{D}^*$; that is
$$
x \ne x' \Rightarrow C(x) \ne C(x')
$$
* The extension $C^*$ of a code $C$ is the mapping from finite-length strings of $\mathcal{X}$ to finite-length strings of $\mathcal{D}$, defined by
$$
C(x_1x_2x\cdots x_n) = C(x_1)C(x_2)\cdots C(x_n)
$$
where $C(x_1)C(x_2)\cdots C(x_n)$ indicates concatenation of the corresponding codewords
* A code is called uniquely decodable if its extension is non-singular
* A code is called a prefix code or an instantaneous code if no codeword is a prefix of any other codeword
	* An instantaneous code is a self-punctuating code

### 5.2 Kraft Inequality
* For any instantaneous code (prefix code) over an alphabet of size D, the codeword lengths $l_1, l_2, \dots, l_m$ must satisfy the inequality
$$
\sum_i D^{-l_i} \le 1
$$
Conversely, given a set of codeword lengths that satisfy this inequality, there exists an instantaneous code with these word lengths
* (Extended Kraft Inequality) For any countably infinite set of codewords that form a prefix code, the codeword lengths satisfy the extended Kraft inequality
$$
\sum_{i=1}^\infty D^{-l_i} \le 1
$$
Conversely, given any $l_1, l_2, \dots$ satisfying the extended Kraft inequality, we can construct a prefix code with these codeword lengths

### 5.3 Optimal Codes
* The expected length L of any instantaneous D-ary code for a random variable X si greater than or equal to the entropy $H_D(X)$; that is
$$
L \ge H_D(X)
$$
with equality if and only if $D^{-l_i} = p_i$
* A probability distribution is called $D$-adic if each of the probabilities is equal to $D^{-n}$ for some $n$, thus we have equality in the (previous) theorem if and only if the distribution of $X$ is $D$-adic

### 5.4 Bounds on the Optimal Code Length
* Let $l_1^*, l_2^*, \dots, l_m^*$ be optimal codeword lengths for a source distribution $p$ and a $D$-ary alphabet, and let $L^*$ be the associated expected length of an optimal code ($L^* = \sum p_i l_i^*$). Then
$$
H_D(X) \le L^* < H_D(X) + 1
$$
* The minimum expected codeword length per symbol satisfies
$$
\frac{H(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)}{n} \le L_n^* < \frac{H(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)}{n} + \frac{1}{n}
$$
Moreover, if X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n is a stationary stochastic process,
$$
L_n^* \rightarrow H(\mathcal{X})
$$
where $H(\mathcal{X})$ is the entropy rate of the process
* (Wrong code) The expected length under $p(x)$ of the code assignment $l(x) = \left\lceil \log \frac{1}{q(x)} \right\rceil$ satifies
$$
H(p) + D(p || q) \le E_pl(X) < H(p) + D(p || q) + 1
$$

### 5.5 Kraft Inequality for Uniquely Decodable Codes
* (McMillan) The codeword lengths of any uniquely decodable $D$-ary code must satisfy the Kraft inequality
$$
\sum D^{-l_i} \le 1
$$
Conversely, given a set of codeword lengths that satisfy this inequality, it is possible to construct a uniquely decodable code with these codeword lengths

### 5.8 Optimality of Huffman Codes
* It is important to remember that there are many optimal codes: inverting all the bits or exchanging two codewords of the same length will give another optimal code
* For any distribution, there exists an optimal instantaneous code (with minimum expected length) that satisfies the following properties
	* The length are ordered inversely with the probabilities (i.e., if $p_j > p_k$, then $l_j \le l_k$)
	* The two longest codewords have the same length
	* Two of the longest codewords differ only in the last bit and correspond to the two least likely symbols
* Shannon code
$$
l_i = \left\lceil \log_D \frac{1}{p_i} \right\rceil
$$
$$
H_D(X) \le L < H_D(X) + 1
$$
* Huffmann code
$$
L^* = \min_{\sum D^{-l_i} \le 1} \sum p_i l_i
$$
$$
H_D(X) \le L^* < H_D(X) + 1
$$
* Wrong code: $X \sym p(x), l(x) = \left\lceil \log \frac{1}{q(x)} \right\rceil, L = \sum p(x)l(x)
$$
H(p) + D(p||q) \le L < H(p) + D(p||q) + 1
$$

## Chapter 6 - Gambling and Data Compression
### 6.4 The Entropy of English
* The entropy of the zeroth-order model is log 27 = 4.76 bits (27 => 26 letters + space)
* The first-order model gives an estimate of the entropy of 4.03 bits per letter, while the fourth-order model gives an estimate of 2.8 bits per letter

* Doubling rate
$$
W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p}) = E(\log S(X)) = \sum_{k=1}^m p_k \log b_k o_k
$$
* Optimal doubling rate
$$
W^*(\textbf{p}) = \max_{\textbf{b}} W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})
$$
* Proportional gambling is log-optimal
$$
W^*(\textbf{p}) = \max_{\textbf{b}} W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p}) = \sum p_i \log o_i - H(\textbf{p})
$$
is achieved by $\textbf{b}^* = \textbf{p}$
* Growth rate: Wealth grows as $S_n \doteq 2^{nW^*(\textbf{p})}$
* Conservation law: For uniform fair odds,
$$
H(\textbf{p}) + W^*(\textbf{p}) = \log m
$$
* Side information: In a horse race $X$, the increase $\Delta W$ in doubling rate due to side information $Y$ is
$$
\Delta W = I(X; Y)
$$

## Chapter 7 - Channel Capacity
* We define a discrete channel to be a system consisting of an input alphabet $\mathcal{X}$ and output alphabet $\mathcal{Y}$ and a probability transition matrix $p(y|x)$ that expresses the probability of observing the output symbol $y$ given that we send the symbol $x$
* The channel is said to be memoryless if the probability distribution of the output depends only on the input at that time and is conditionally independent of previous channel inputs or outputs
* We define "information" channel capacity of a discrete memoryless channel as
$$
C = \max_{p(x)} I(X; Y)
$$

### 7.2 Symmetric Channels
* A channel is said to be symmetric if the rows of the channel transition matrix $p(y|x)$ are permutations of each other and the columns are permutations of each other
* A channel is said to be weakly symmetric if every row of the transition matrix $p(\cdot|x)$ is a permutation of every other row and all the column sums $\sum_x p(y|x)$ are equal
* For a weakly symmetric channel,
$$
C = \log|\mathcal{Y}| - H(\text{row of the transition matrix})
$$
and this is achieved by a uniform distribution on the input alphabet

### 7.3 Properties of Channel Capacity
* $C \ge 0$ since $I(X; Y) \ge 0$
* $C \le \log|\mathcal{X}|$ since $C = \max I(X; Y) \le \max H(X) = \log|\mathcal{X}|$
* $C \le \log|\mathcal{Y}|$ for the same reason
* $I(X; Y)$ is a continuous function of $p(x)$
* $I(X; Y)$ is a concave function of $p(x)$

### 7.5 Definitions
* A discrete channel, denoted by $(\mathcal{X}, p(y|x), \mathcal{Y})$, consists of two finite sets $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ and a collection of probability mass functions $(y|x)$, one for each $x \in \mathcal{X}$, such that for every $x$ and $y$, $p(y|x) \ge 0$, and for every $x$, $\sum_y p(y|x) = 1$, with the interpretation that $X$ is the input and $Y$ is the output of the channel
* The n-th extension of the discrete memoryless channel (DMC) is the channel $(\mathcal{X}^n, p(y^n|x^n), \mathcal{Y}^n)$ where
$$
p(y_k|x^k, y^{k-1}) = p(y_k|x_k), k = 1, 2, \dots, n
$$
* An $(M, n)$ code for the channel $(\mathcal{X}, p(y|x), \mathcal{Y})$ consists of the following:
	* An index set $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$
	* An encoding function $X^n$: $\{1, 2, \dots, M\} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$, yielding codewords $x^n(1), x^n(2), \dots, x^n(M)$. The set of codewords is called the codebook
	* A decoding function
$$
g: \mathcal{Y}^n \rightarrow \{1, 2, \dots, M\}
$$
which is a deterministic rule that assigns a guess to each possible received vector
* The rate $R$ of an $(M, n)$ code is
$$
R = \frac{\log M}{n} \text{bits per transmission}
$$
* A rate $R$ is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of $(\left\lceil 2^{nR} \right\rceil, n)$ codes such that the maximal probability of error $\lambda^{(n)}$ tends to 0 as $n \rightarrow \infty$
* The capacity of a channel is the supremum of all achievable rates

### 7.6 Jointly Typical Sequences
* The set $A_\epsilon^{(n)}$ of jointly typical sequences $\{x^n, y^n\}$ with respect to the distribution $p(x, y)$ is the set of $n$-sequences with empirical entropies $\epsilon$-close to the true entropies
$$
A_\epsilon^{(n)} = \left\{(x^n, y^n) \in \mathcal{X}^n \times \mathcal{Y}^n : \\
\left|\frac{1}{n}\log p(x^n) - H(x)\right| < \epsilon, \\
\left|\frac{1}{n}\log p(y^n) - H(Y)\right| < \epsilon, \\
\left|\frac{1}{n}\log p(x^n, y^n) - H(X, Y)\right| < \epsilon\right\} \\
$$
where
$$
p(x^n, y^n) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i, y_i)
$$

### 7.7 Channel Coding Theorem
* Channel coding theorem: For a discrete memoryless channel, all rates below capacity $C$ are achievable. Specifically, for every rate $R < C$, there exists a sequence of $(2^{nR}, n)$ codes with maximum probability of error $\lambda^{(n)} \rightarrow 0$.
	* Conversely, any sequences of $(2^{nR}, n)$ codes with $\lambda^{(n)} \rightarrow 0$ must have $R \le C$

### 7.9 Fano's Inequality and the Converse to the Coding Theorem
* Strong converse: for rates above capacity, the probability of error goes exponentially to 1
* At rates below capacity $P_e^{(n)} \rightarrow 0$ exponentially, and at rates above capacity $P_e^{(n)} \rightarrow 1$ exponentially

### 7.10 Equality in the Converse to the Channel Coding Theorem
* A capacity-achieving zero-error code has distinct codewords and the distribution of the $Y_i$'s must be i.i.d. with
$$
p^*(y) = \sum_x p*(x)p(y|x)
$$
the distribution on $Y$ induced by the optimum distribution on $X$

### 7.11 Hamming Codes
* The object of coding is to introduce redundancy so that even if some of the information is lost or corrupted, it will still be possible to recover the message at the receiver
* Obvious coding scheme: repeat information (0 -> 00000, 1 -> 11111), 3 bits out of 5 implies the predicted bit
* Parity check code: With a block of $n-1$ information bits, we choose the $n$th bit so that the parity of the entire block is 0 (the number of 1's in the block is even)

### 7.12 Feedback Capacity
* Can we do better with feedback? The surprising answer is no
* The capacity with feedback, $C_{FB}$, of a discrete memoryless channel is the supremum of all rates achievable by feedback codes
$$
C_{FB} = C = \max_{p(x)} I(X; Y)
$$
* Feedback can help enormously in simplifying encoding and decoding
* However, it cannot increase the capacity of the channel

### 7.13 Source-Channel Separation Theorem
* We can consider the design of a communication system as a combination of two parts, source coding and channel coding
* We can design source codes for the most efficient representation of the data
* We can, separately and independently, design channel codes appropriate for the channel
* The combination will be as effective as anything we could design by considering both problems together
* The common representation for all kinds of data uses a binary alphabet
* We have a source $V$ that generates symbols from an alphabet $\mathcal{V}$
	* We will not make any assumptions about the kind of stochastic process produced by $V$ other than it is from a finite alphabet that satisfies the AEP
* We want to send the sequence of symbols $V^n = V_1, V_2, \dots, V_n$ over the channel so that the receiver can reconstruct the sequence
* To do this, we map the sequence onto a codeword $X^n(V^n)$ and send the codeword over the channel
* The receiver looks at his received sequence $Y^n$ and makes an estimate $\hat{V^n}$ of the sequence $V^n$ that was sent
* The receiver makes an error if $V^n \ne \hat{V^n}$
* We define the probability of error as
$$
\Pr(V^n \ne \hat{V^n}) = \sum_{y^n} \sum_{v^n} p(v^n)p(y^n|x^n(v^n))I(g(y^n) \ne v^n))
$$
where $I$ is the indicator function and $g(y^n)$ is the decoding function
* (Source-channel coding theorem) If $V_1, V_2, \dots, V^n$ is a finite alphabet stochastic process that satisfies the AEP and $H(\mathcal{V}) < C$, there exists a source-channel code with probability of error $\Pr(\hat{V^n} \ne V^n) \rightarrow 0$. Conversely, for any stationary stochastic process, if $H(\mathcal{V}) > C$, the probability of error is bounded away from zero, and it is not possible to send the process over the channel with arbitrarily low probability of error

## Chapter 8 - Differential Entropy
### 8.1 Definitions
* The differential entropy $h(X)$ of a continuous random variable $X$ with density $f(x)$ is defined as
$$
h(X) = - \int_S f(x)\log f(x)\ dx
$$
where $S$ is the support set of the random variable

## Chapter 13 - Universal Source Coding
* For many practical situations, the probability distribution underlying the source may be unknown
* All we know is a class of distributions
* One possible approach is to wait until we have seen all the data, estimate the distribution from the data, use this distribution to construct the best code, and then go back to the beginning and compress the data using this code
* There are many situations in which it is not feasible to make two passes over the data, and it is desirable to have a one-pass (or online) algorithm to compress the data that "learns" the probability distribution of the data and uses it to compress the incoming symbols
* In yet other cases, there is no probability distribution underlying the data - all we are given is an individual sequence of outcomes
* How well can we compress a sequence? If we do not put any restriction on the class of algorithms, we get a meaningless answer - there always exists a function that compresses a particular sequence to one bit while leaving other sequences uncompressed
* The ultimate answer for compressibility for an individual sequence is the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence
* Let's consider the problem of source coding as a game in which the coder chooses a code that attempts to minimize the average length of the representation and nature chooses a distribution on the source sequence
* We show that this game has a value that is related to the capacity of a channel with rows of its transition matrix that are the possible distributions on the source sequence

### 13.2 Universal Coding for Binary Sequences
* We first describe an offline algorithm to describe the sequence; we count the number of 1's in the sequence, and after we have seen the entire sequence, we send a two-stage description of the sequence.
	* The first stage is a count of the number of 1's in the sequence
	* The second stage is the index of this sequence among all sequences that have $k$ 1's
* We now describe a different approach using a mixture distribution that achieves the same result on the fly. We choose the coding distribution $q(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = 2^{-l(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)}$ to be a uniform mixture of all $\text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$ distributions on $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$
* This mixture distribution yields a nice expression for the conditional probability of the next symbol given the previous symbols of $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. Let $k_i$ be the number of 1's in the first $i$ symbols of $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$
$$
q(x_{i+1} = 1 | x^i) = \frac{k_i + 1}{i + 2}
$$

### 13.3 Arithmetic Coding
* In arithmetic coding, instead of using a sequence of bits to represent a symbol, we represent it by a subinterval of the unit interval
* The code for a sequence of symbols is an interval whose length decreases as we add more symbols to the sequence

### 13.4 Lempel-Ziv Coding
* The key idea of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm is to parse the string into phrases and to replace phrases by pointers to where the same string has occurred in the past

#### 13.4.1 Sliding Window Lempel-Ziv Algorithm
* The algorithm described in the 1977 paper encodes a string by finding the longest match anywhere within a window of past symbols and represents the string by a pointer to the location of the match within the window and the length of the match
* We assume that we have a string $x_1, x_2, \dots$ to be compressed from a finite alphabet
* A parsing $S$ of a string $x_1 x_2 \dots sx_n$ is a division of the string into phrases, separated by commas
* Let $W$ be the length of the window
* The algorithm can be described as follows:
	* Assume that we have compressed the string until time $i - 1$
	* TO find the next phrase, find the largest $k$ such that for some $j$, $i - 1 - W \le j \le i - 1$, the string of length $k$ starting at $x_j$ is equal to the string (of length $k$) starting at $x_i$
	* The next phrase is then of length $k$ and is represented by the pair $(P, L)$, where $P$ is the location of the beginning of the match and $L$ is the length of the match
	* If a match is not found in the window, the next character is sent uncompressed
	* To distinguish between these two cases, a flag bit is needed, and hence the phrase are of two types:
		* $(F, P, L)$
		* $(F, C)$
		where $C$ represents an uncompressed character

#### 13.4.2 Tree-Structured Lempel-Ziv Algorithms
* Parses a string into phrases, where each phrase is the shortest phrase not seen earlier
* This algorithm can be viewed as building a dictionary in the form of a tree, where the nodes correspond to phrases seen so far

## Chapter 14 - Kolmogorov Complexity
* Kolmogorov defined the algorithmic (descriptive) complexity of an object to be the length of the shortest binary computer program that describes the object
* The definition of complexity is essentially computer independent
* The expected length of the shortest binary computer description of a random variable is approximately equal to its entropy

### 14.2 Kolomogorov Complexity: Definitions and Examples
* Let $x$ be a finite-length binary string and let $\mathcal{U}$ be a universal computer
* Let $l(x)$ denote the length of the string $x$
* Let $\mathcal{U}$ denote the output of the computer $\mathcal{U}$ when presented with a program $p$
* We define the Kolmogorov (or algorithmic) complexity of a string $x$ as the minimal description length of $x$
* The Kolmogorov complexity $K_{\mathcal{U}}(x)$ of a string $x$ with respect to a universal computer $\mathcal{U}$ is defined as
$$
K_{\mathcal{U}}(x) = \min_{p:\ \mathcal{U}(p) = x} l(p)
$$
the minimum length over all programs that print $x$ and halt
* The conditional Kolmogorov complexity knowing $l(x)$ is
$$
K_{\mathcal{U}}(x|l(x)) = \min_{p:\ \mathcal{U}(p, l(x)) = x} l(p)
$$
* If $\mathcal{U}$ is a universal computer, for any other computer $\mathcal{A}$ there exists a constant $c_\mathcal{A}$ such that
$$
K_{\mathcal{U}}(x) \le K_{\mathcal{A}}(x) + c_{\mathcal{A}}
$$
for all strings $x \in \{0, 1\}^*$, and the constant $c_{\mathcal{A}}$ does not depend on $x$
* Conditional complexity is less than the length of the sequence
$$
K(x|l(x)) \le l(x) + c
$$
* Conditional complexity is less than the length of the sequence
$$
K(x|l(x)) \le l(x) + c
$$
* Upper bound on Kolmogorov complexity
$$
K(x) \le K(x|l(x)) + 2 \log l(x) + c
$$
* Lower bound on Kolmogorov complexity. The number of strings $x$ with complexity $K(x) < k$ satisfies
$$
|\{x \in \{0, 1\}^*: K(x) < k\}| < 2^k
$$

### 14.3 Kolmogorov Complexity and Entropy
* For any computer $\mathcal{U}$,
$$
\sum_{p:\ \mathcal{U}(p)\ \text{halts}} 2^{-l(p)} \le 1
$$

### 14.5 Algorithmically Random and Incompressible
* Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be drawn according to a Bernolli $(\frac{1}{2})$ process. Then
$$
P(K(X_1 X_2 \dots X_n | n) < n - k) < 2^{-k}
$$
* A sequence $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is said to be algorithmically random if
$$
K(x_1 x_2 \dots x_n | n) \ge n
$$
* We call an infinite string $x$ incompressible if
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{K(x_1 x_2 \dots x_n | n)}{n} = 1
$$
* If a string $x_1 x_2 \dots$ is incompressible, it satisfies the law of large numbers in the sense that
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}
$$

### 14.6 Universal Probability
* The universal probability of a string $x$ is
$$
P_{\mathcal{U}}(x) = \sum_{p:\ \mathcal{U}(p) = x} 2^{-l(p)} = \Pr(\mathcal{U}(p) = x)c
$$
(the probability that a program randomly drawn as a sequence of fair coin flips will print out the string $x$)

### 14.7 The Halting Problem and the Noncomputability of Kolmogorov Complexity
* One of the consequences of the nonexistence of an algorithm for the halting problem is the noncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity
* The only way to find the shortest program in general is to try all short programs and see which of them can do the job
	* However, at any time some of the short programs may not have halted and there is no effective (finite mechanical) way to tell whether or not they will halt and what they will print out
* The noncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity is an example of the Berry paradox
	* The berry paradox asks for the shortest number not nameable in under 10 words
* The shortest program is not computable, although as more and more programs are shown to produce the string, the estimates from above of the Kolmogorov complexity converge to the true Kolmogorov complexity

### 14.8 $\Omega$
$$
\Omega = \sum_{p:\ \mathcal{U}(p)\ \text{halts}} 2^{-l(p)}
$$
* Let $\Omega_n = .\omega_1 \omega_2 \cdots \omega_n$ denote the first $n$ bits of $\Omega$. The properties of $\Omega$ are as follows:
	* $\Omega$ is noncomputable. There is no effective (finite, mechanical) way to check whether arbitrary programs halt, so there is no effective way to compute $\Omega$
	* $\Omega$ is a "philosopher's stone". Knowing $\Omega$ to an accuracy of $n$ bits will enable us to decide the truth of any provable or finitely refutable mathematical theorem that can be written in less than $n$ bits
	* $\Omega$ is algorithmically random
* $\Omega$ cannot be compressed by more than a constant; that is, there exists a constant $c$ such that
$$
K(\omega_1 \omega_2 \cdots \omega_n) \ge n - c \qquad \text{for all n}
$$

### 14.9 Universal Gambling
* Suppose that a gambler is asked to gamble sequentially on sequences $x \in \{0, 1\}^*$
* He is given fair odds (2-for-1)
* Let the wealth $S(x)$ associated with betting scheme $b(x)$, $\sum b(x) = 1$, be given by
$$
S(x) = 2^{l(x)} b(x)
$$
* Suppose that the gambler bets $b(x) = 2^{-K(x)}$ on a string $x$. This betting strategy can be called universal gambling. We note that the sum of the bets
$$
\sum b(x) = \sum 2^{-K(x)} \ge 2^{-K(x)} = \sum_{p:\ p\ \text{halts}} 2^{-l(p)} = \Omega \le 1
$$
* The logarithm of the wealth a gambler achieves on a sequence using universal gambling plus the complexity of the sequence is no smaller than the length of the sequence, or
$$
\log S(x) + K(x) \ge l(x)
$$

### 14.12 Kolmogorov Sufficient Statistic
* Suppose that we are given a sample sequence from a $Bernoulli(\theta)$ process. What are the regularities or deviations from randomness in this sequence?
* The Kolmogorov structure function $K_k(x^n | n)$ of a binary string $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ is defined as
$$
K_k(x^n | n) = \min_{
\begin{gather}
	p: l(p) \le k \\
	\mathcal{U}(p, n) = S \\
	x^n \in S \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n
\end{gather}
} \log |S|
$$
* The set $S$ is the smallest set that can be described with no more than $k$ bits and which includes $x^n$
* By $\mathcal{U}(p, n) = S$, we mean that running the program $p$ with data $n$ on the universal computer $\mathcal{U}$ will print out the indicator function of the set $S$
* A statistic $T$ is said to be sufficient for a parameter $\theta$ if the distribution of the sample given the sufficient statistic is independent of the parameter; that is
$$
\theta \rightarrow T(X) \rightarrow X
$$

### 14.13 Minimum Description Length Principle
* Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be drawn i.i.d. according to probability mass function $p(x)$. We assume that we do not know $p(x)$, but know that $p(x) \in \mathcal{P}$, a class of probability mass functions
* Minimum description length (MDL) principle: Given data and a choice of models, choose the model such that the description of the model plus the conditional description of the data is as short as possible
* Find $p(x) \in \mathcal{P}$ that minimizes
$$
L_p(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) = K(p) + \log \frac{1}{p(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)}
$$
* This is the length of a two-stage description of the data, where we first describe the distribution $p$ and then, given the distribution, construct the Shannon code and describe the data using $\log \frac{1}{p(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)}$ bits

## Chapter 16 - Information Theory and Portfolio Theory
### 16.1 The Stock Market: Some Definitions
* A stock market is represented as a vector of stocks $\boldsymbol{X} = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m)$, $X_i \ge 0$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, m$ where $m$ is the number of stocks and the price relative $X_i$ is the ratio of the price at the end of the day to the price at the beginning of the day
* Typically, $X_i$ is near 1
* Let $\boldsymbol{X} \sim F(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the joint distribution of the vector of price relatives
* A portfolio $\boldsymbol{b} = (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m)$, $b_i \ge 0$, $\sum b_i = 1$, is an allocation of wealth across the stocks
	* $b_i$ is the fraction of one's wealth invested in stock $i$
* If one uses a portfolio $\boldsymbol{b}$ and the stock vector is $\boldsymbol{X}$, the wealth relative (ratio of wealth at the end of the day to the wealth at the beginning of the day) is $S = \boldsymbol{b}^t\boldsymbol{X} = \sum_{i=1}^m b_iX_i$
* The standard theory of stock market investment is based on consideration of the first and second moments of $S$
	* The objective is to maximize the expected value of $S$ subject to a constraint on the variance
* The growth rate of a stock market portfolio $\boldsymbol{b}$ with respect to a stock distribution $F(\boldsymbol{x})$ is defined as
$$
W(\boldsymbol{b}, F) = \int \log \boldsymbol{b}^t \boldsymbol{x}\ dF(\boldsymbol{x}) = E(\log \boldsymbol{b}^t \boldsymbol{X})
$$
* The optimal growth rate $W^*(F)$ is defined as
$$
W^*(F) = \max_b W(\boldsymbol{b}, F)
$$
* A portfolio $\boldsymbol{b}^*$ that achieves the maximum of $W(\boldsymbol{b}, F)$ is called a log-optimal portfolio or growth optimal portfolio

### 16.7 Universal Portfolios
#### 16.7.1 Finite-Horizon Universal Portfolios
* Consider the case of two stocks and a single day. Let the stock vector for the day be $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2)$. If $x_1 > x_2$, the best portfolio is one that puts all its money on stock 1, and if $x_2 > x_1$, the best portfolio puts all its money on stock 2
* Our opponent can choose the stock market sequence after we have chosen our portfolio to make us do as badly as possible relative to the best portfolio
* Given our portfolio, the opponent can ensure that we do as badly as possible by making the stock on which we have put more weight equal to 0 and the other stock equal to 1. Our best strategy is therefore to put equal weight on both stocks, and with this, we will achieve a growth factor at least equal to half the growth factor of the best stock, and hence we will achieve at least half the gain of the best constantly rebalanced portfolio
