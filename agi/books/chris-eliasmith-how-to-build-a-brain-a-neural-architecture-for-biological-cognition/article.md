# Notes
## 1. The Science of Cognition
### 1.1 The Last 50 Years
* Explaining reaction times addresses only a small part of cognitive system dynamics in general, and the ACT-R explanations rely on assuming a 50 ms "cycle time," which itself is not explained
* If you want to build a fast cognitive system - one that directly interacts with the physics of the world - then the most salient constraints on your system are the physical dynamics of actions and perception
* What is a cognitive system? A system that integrates all aspects of sophisticated behavior. It is a system that must simultaneously realize a wide array of biological behaviors
* Good questions outrank easy answers

### 1.2 How We Got Here
* I consider a cognitive architecture to be "a general proposal about the representations and processes that produce intelligent thought"
* In the last half-century, there have been three major approaches to theorizing about the nature of cognition
	* The classical symbolic approach (symbolicism or Good Old-fashioned Artificial Intelligence)
	* Connectionism (Parallel Distributed Processing)
	* Dynamicism: Cognitive systems are non-representational, low-dimensional, dynamical systems. Cognitive systems can only be properly understood by characterizing their state changes through time
* Classical control theory characterizes physical systems by identifying a "transfer function" that directly maps inputs to outputs
	* Does not consider the internal states of a system
* Once cognitive scientists began to think of minds as computers, a number of new theoretical tools became available for characterizing cognition
* It suggested novel philosophical theses
	* Functionalism: the notion that only the mathematical function computed by a system is relevant for its being a mind or not
	* Multiple realizability: the notion that a mind could be implemented in pretty much any substrate - water, silicon, interstellar gas, etc. - as long as it computed the appropriate function
