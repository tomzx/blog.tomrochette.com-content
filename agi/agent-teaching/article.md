While one agent may be smarter than another, it does not necessarily mean that the smarter agent will be able to teach the less smart agent to reach the its level of intelligence.
This may be explained either by the fact that the less smart agent may refuse to learn or may be unable to learn.
In the case where the agent is actively refusing to learn one needs to understand the motivation behind the refusal.
In the case where the agent is unable to learn one needs to determine the missing characteristics that allow for learning.
For the purpose of science and improvement, it should be considered whether it is possible to create or provide external tools or mechanisms that would allow for an agent unable to learn to do so.
One could see the agent and this new external learner as the agent itself, acting together in some kind of symbiosis.
Note that this is different from our initial intent where we want to be able to teach an agent which cannot learn, as the approach mentioned would simply avoid solving this problem by introducing a component that can learn.
