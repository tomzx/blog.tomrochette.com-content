# Overview

## How can we deal with large amounts of information?
* Know it exists
* Find it
* Keep it up to date

Information organization is critical. Similar to how a dictionary is organized/ordered in alphabetical order, information needs to be organized in some fashion as to make retrieval relatively simple and efficient given rules on how to perform retrieval. It is acceptable to trade rule complexity for faster retrieval.

To know information exists, the information has to be dismantled into its components. Some components will be considered critical/unique enough to be used as instance identifiers (similar to how one would do object equality in a programming language).

Keeping information up to date means that you need to know it exists and that you've found its previous iteration so that it may be updated with the up-to-date information.
