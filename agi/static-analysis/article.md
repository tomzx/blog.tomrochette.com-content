## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Spectral graph theory

## Tools
* Graph/tree theory
* Linear algebra

# Overview
* Use adjacency matrices to represent a control flow graph, allows you to do operations easily (get children (nodes to which a given node may go) = $V \cdot A$, get parents (nodes from which a given node might come from) = $V \cdot A^T$ (matrix transpose))[^1]

# Basic program structure
* Fileset creation and filtering based on masks and regexes
* Initial AST construction for the fileset
* Analysis passes
* Output of diagnosis messages

# Object analysis
* Track all properties
* Mark all properties that are read/written in each method
* Track function calls
* Track all methods signature (parameter types and return type)
