## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Cortical cells are orientation detectors
* Simple cells
	* React to stimuli (light) along a line
	* Respond to flashing and moving edges
* Complex cells
	* React to stimuli (light) moving in a specific direction
	* Respond to moving edges and are often direction selective
* Hypercomplex cells
	* React to stimuli (light) moving in a specific direction, with the right width and height
	* Are selective for the length of a moving edge
