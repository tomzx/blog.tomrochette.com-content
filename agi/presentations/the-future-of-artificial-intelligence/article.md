## Context

If you've already seen Hamis Hassabis presentation [General Learning Algorithms](../general-learning-algorithms/article.md), you may skip to 27:25 since most of the content he covers is already covered in this other presentation. This content will not be covered here, so please refer to the other presentation article.

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
## AlphaGo
* Pattern recognition with planning

## Go
* 3000 years old
* 40M players
* $10^{170}$ positions
* 2 rules
	* Rule #1: The capture rule: Stones are captured when they have no liberties
	* Rule #2: The "Ko" Rule: A repeated board position is not allowed

## Why is it hard for computers to play?
* The complexity makes brute force exhaustive search intractable
* Two main challenges
	* The branching factor is huge
	* Writing an evaluation function to determine who is winning is thought to be impossible
* Go is a game of intuition
* Computes are not very good at replicating intuition
* In chess, one can use heuristics to roughly determinate who's winning
* In go, this is not possible as each pieces have the same value

## Training the deep neural networks
* Download 100K games from amateur play
* Train a supervised learning policy network to try and copy those "expert" players
* Train through a reinforcement learning policy network by playing against itself
* Generate new data (30M positions) which will help produce an evaluation function
* Build a value network which indicates, based on the current board, who's winning the game and estimates by how much

## Two networks: Policy and Value Nets
* Policy network: Probability distribution over moves
* Value network: A real number between 0 and 1, where 0 is white winning, 1 is black winning and 0.5 is the game is even
* The policy network can be thought of as reducing the breadth of the search tree
* The value network can be thought of as reducing the depth of the search tree

## Combining Neural Nets with Tree Search and Rollouts
* Q - Action value of a move
* Do a little bit of searching in the tree
* Find a couple of promising moves
* Find the moves that have the maximum Q values
* Follow the trajectory that has a high Q value until we hit a node that hasn't been explored yet
* First, we call the policy network to expand the tree at that point but only for the moves with the highest prior (P) probability of that move occurring
* Second, we call the value network to evaluate that position and give an estimate of who is winning
* We also do another thing if we have time, which is rollouts to the end of the game (maybe a few thousands) to collect "true" statistics about who ends up winning the game from that position
* Then, we combine these two estimates (from the value network and the rollouts) to give a final estimation

## Testing
* Internal testing: Different version of AlphaGo playing against itself 24/7
* Calibration: Play against external programs such as Zen and CrazyStone
* In April 2015: Winning 99% of games against Zen and CrazyStone
* In October 2015: Could beat the April 2015 version 100% of the time and beat Fan Hui 5 out of 5
* In March 2016: No estimate against the October 2015 version. Lee Sedol can beat Fan Hui about 97% of the time
