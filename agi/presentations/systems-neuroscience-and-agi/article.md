## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* How can we know/measure we're making progress toward AGI
* Non-biological approach vs biological approach
* Issues with the non-biological approach
	* Brittle
	* Time-consuming to train
	* Poor at general learning
	* Difficult to acquire/generate new symbols
	* How do you refer to things outside of the agent? (symbol grounding problem)
* Biological approach
	* The brain as a blueprint
	* Covers a large class of approaches
* Different search spaces of possible AGI solutions
	* Regime 1: Small and dense search space
		* Not worth too much relying on the human brain design
	* Regime 2: Large and sparse search space
		* Worth a lot to rely on the human brain  design
* Evidence points to regime 2:
	* Evolution has only produced human level intelligence once
	* Large non-biological projects failed to make progress

## Approaches to AGI (from abstract to biological)
* Cognitive science architectures: SOAR (Laird/Newell), ACT-R (Andersen), OpenCog (Goertzel)
	* Unsatisfactory because they're besed on introspection and when changes in knowledge occurs, they have to modify their model to fit in this new understanding
* System neuroscience: the brain algorithms
* Brain emulation: Blue Brain (Markram), SyNAPSE (Modha)
	* Not telling us about the internal processes/functions going inside the brain
	* Relying on very intricate imaging techniques (at what level do we need to stop? Calcium ion channels? Atoms?)

## Marr's three levels of analysis
* Computational: What - the goals of the system
* Algorithmic: How - the representations and algorithms
* Implementation: Medium - the physical realisation of the system

## Rapid advances in neuroscience
* Revolution in cognitive neuroscience
* New experimental techniques
* Sophisticated analysis tools
* Exponential growth in understanding
* Actively conduct neuroscience research useful for building AGI

## Role of neuroscience
* Likely that neuroscience will have a big role in building AGI
* As an orthogonal source of information to Machine Learning
* Provides direction: inspiration for new algorithms/architectures
* Validation testing: does an algorithm consistute a viable component of an AGI system?
* How can it not be a net benefit in the quest for AGI systems to add neuroscience knowledge into the mix?

## The hybrid approach
* Combine the best of machine learning and neuroscience
* Where we know how to build a component
	* Use the latest state-of-the-art algorithms
* Where we don't know how to build a component
	* Continue to push pure machine learning approaches hard
	* In parallel, also look to systems neuroscience for solutions

## Systems neuroscience procedure
* Extract the principles behind an algorithm the brain uses
* Creatively re-implment that in a computational model
* Result: a state-of-the-art technique and AGI component

## Intermediate goals
* Full embodied physical robots: throws up complex engineering problems whilst distracting from the main problem of intelligence
* Toddler AGI: AI-controlled robot that display qualitatively similar cognitive behaviours to a young human child (~3yo)
* Massive breadth of capabilities required = extremely hard

## Core AGI
* Core capabilities:
	* Conceptual knowledge acquisition/representation
	* Planning and prediction abilities

## Concepts are key
* Knowledge in the brain
	* Symbols
	* Conceptual
	* Perceptual
* Equivalent machine learning algorithms
	* Logic networks
	* ???
	* DBN, HMAX, HTM
* So how does the brain acquire conceptual knowledge?

## Hippocampal-neocortical consolidation
* Hippocampus sits at the apex of the sensory cortex
* High-level neocortex: association and prefrontal cortex
* Stores the memories of recent experiences or episodes
* Replays those memories during sleep at speeded rates
* Gives high-level neocortex samples to learn from
* Memories selected stochastically for replay
* Rewarded: emotional or salient memories replayed more
* Circumvents the statistics of the external environment
* (Hypothesis) Leads to abstraction and semantic knowledge

## Interim milestones
* Build knowledge on top of existing knowledge
* Abstract classification: classification of empty/full containers
* Discovery of higher-order structures (eg. 123456789101112131...) What is the next number? Statistics is not enough
* Algorithms that can build sophisticated models of the environment (eg. play any card game just by observing a raw perceptual stream)
* Transfer learning: learning a response in one perceptual context, abstracting a rule, and applying it correctly in a new context
* Some impressive things have already happened:
	* MoGo - first program to beat a professional human go player
	* IBM's Watson - taking on human champions at Jeopardy quiz show

## How to measure progress?
* One approach: measure success across a suite of tasks
* Ideally we'd like a more integrated measure of progress
* Algorithmic Intelligence Quotient (AIQ)

## Predictions
* Systems neuroscience understanding will help inspire to several key components of the overall AGI puzzle
* System with transfer learning and conceptual knowledge acquisition capabilities will appear in the next 5 years
* Measurement tools charting progress are improving all the time
* Once interim milestones have been achieved, we will have a better understanding of of intelligence and the safety issues involved
* Probably ~20+ years for full human-level AGI but lots of interesting technologies will be built on the way
