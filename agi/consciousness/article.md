## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* What can consciousness (and unconsciousness) tell us about the brain?
* Is a program "alive" because it is executing? As long as it is not being executed it is only data, but once it is being executed, it takes a life of itself.
	* In other words, one could quantify living based on the fact that a machine is executing operations (at a certain rate which makes it possible to determine they are doing something from the point of view of an observer)
