The articles contained within this repository are mostly works in progress. I try to explore various topics that interest me and think through them at various points in time.

I try to explore the following topics:

* Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Intelligence Augmentation (IA)
* Intelligence
* Cognition
* Reality
* Humans as machines
* Computer architecture
* Chatbots
* Natural language processing
* and many more topics

Feel free to leave me comments, questions and feedback through [github issues](https://github.com/tomzx/blog.tomrochette.com-content/issues)!
