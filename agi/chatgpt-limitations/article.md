## Things to explore

# Overview
* It does not execute actions, but it can generate text explaining what actions to take. While this is a current limitation that is addressed by plugins, the next logical step is to have ChatGPT execute actions. As an example of a machine learning engineer working on a project, while ChatGPT can help with devising a plan, it cannot execute the plan. If I already have infrastructure and I want help testing different models and hyperparameters, I still need to write the necessary prompts for ChatGPT, verify the code implements my desired intent, copy the generated code, execute it, and then analyze the results. Furthermore, any execution of machine learning code can take from minutes to hours to execute. In other words, while it helps me reduce the amount of time spent on certain tasks such as reflecting, generating a plan, writing code, because it does not execute those, I am still left with doing them myself.
	* Let us imagine a scenario: we want to produce a new classification model and the associated infrastructure to serve real-time predictions.
