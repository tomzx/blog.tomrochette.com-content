## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* $Statement \subseteq Proposition \subset Conclusion$

# Overview

In a discussion, each reply is either
* a new topic
* following the current topic, thus either continuing the existing chain or creating a new one
* replying to an old topic

In an IRC chat, one can use the nick of a user to reply to him, for example:
```
<johnSmith> tomzx: that's pretty nice!
```

Here are a few rules:
* We never reply to statements that were emitted after we emitted our reply (sequentiality of timeline)

Here are a few soft rules (not necessarily true):
* We generally reply to the last statement emitted by the person we're talking with
* We generally do not talk to ourselves
* Many statements emitted by the same emitter in short bursts may be in response to the same statements, or different statements
* An statement emitted after there has been silence for a considerable while generally implies this statement is the start of a new discussion thread

Things that can be done to ease processing:
* Merge all statements from an emitter that have been emitted sequentially (not interrupted by others)
	* This may make the association of future statements more difficult as it may be unclear what part of the merged statements is being replied to

## Building up a context

To associate a sentence with its previous context, the following steps are accomplished:
* read the sentence and extract word cues
* determine the start of the discussion thread by observing various hints:
	* temporally close interlocutors
	* a period of inactivity potentially indicating a topic change

## Discussion complexity
### 1 discussion, 2-people, 1 channel
### 1 discussion, n-people, 1 channel
### n-discussions, 2-people, 1 channel
### n-discussions, n-people, 1 channel
### n-discussions, n-people, n channel

## Agent Interaction Protocol
* Commencement rules
* A collection of locutions
* Combinations rules for the locutions
* A collection of commitments
* Combinations rules for the commitments
* Locution-commitment assignment rules
* Termination rules

// No actors - Monologue

say('I want to create a new github project')
if (ask('Will it have many parts/subprojects?')) {
	say('Create a new organization')
	do('Create project in new organization')
} else {
	say('Create project in personal account')
}

// With language specific verbs - Dialog(2)
tell = say
query = ask

tell('I want to create a new github project') // Tell comes from the first actor
if (ask('Will it have many parts/subprojects?')) { // Ask comes from the second actor
	say('Create a new organization') // Say comes from the second actor
	query('What should it be named?') // Query comes from the first actor
	do('Create project in new organization')
} else {
	say('Create project in personal account')
}

// With actors - Dialogue(3..n)

var alex = actor('alex');
var tom = actor('tom');

alex.say('I want to create a new github project')
if (tom.ask('Will it have many parts/subprojects?')) {
	tom.say('Create a new organization')
	tom.say('Create project in new organization')
	//alex.do('Create project in new organization')
} else {
	tom.say('Create project in personal account')
}

// Actor based - Dialogue (3..n)

tom(function() {
	if (ask('Will it have many parts/subprojects?')) {
		say('Create a new organization')
		say('Create project in new organization')
	} else {
		say('Create project in personal account')
	}
});

// Actions
tell
say
ask
do
wait

// Things it can do

Extract the list of say to create a list of options for a select
Extract prefixes to make a hierarchical list "I want to ...", "I have to..."
