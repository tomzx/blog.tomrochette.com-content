## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How do "non-intelligent" agents solve their problems?
* Can one solve problems without being aware of them?
* Can one solve problems if they don't understand them?
* Let say you are an agent in a given environment and you want to solve problems, what components would you need to do so?

# Overview
* Two types of problems:
	* Ill-defined: No clear goals, solutions path, or expected solution
	* Well-defined: Specific goals, clearly defined solution paths, and clear expected solutions

* Observe a problem
* Determine the causes of the problem
* Generate potential solutions
* Test solutions
* Evaluate and record results
* Iterate

# IDEAL
* Identify the problem
* Define the context of the problem
* Explore possible strategies
* Act on best solution
* Look back and learn

# PDCA/PDSA
* Plan
* Do
* Check/Study
* Act

# Alternative
* Determine micro tasks
	* How does one recognize which micro tasks are necessary? (seems to be based on prior experience)
* Determine constraints (what needs to be done before something else can be done or what can't be done)

# Requirements
* Language: A way to temporarily represent objects/entities and states in order to manipulate them
* Causality decorrelation: The ability to extract the "true" causes and effects relations (what implies what).
* Memory: To store prior experiments and their results. Memories are then reused in order to predict actions-effects (causality) when mentally manipulating models, which should be more energy efficient (and reproducible) than executing the action again.
* The ability to simulate a sequence of action-effect

# Evolution of problem solving with age
* Reflexes
* Random discovery (trial and error)
* Understanding of causality
* Pattern recognition
* Reuse of developed algorithms
* Learning from others
* Fine-tuning of acquired skills

# Level of abstraction by age
* Equation with numbers and missing total
* Variable manipulation
* Spatial reasoning
* Problem recognition and application of the proper tools to solve them problem
