## Context
Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation[^1]. It is the question of figuring out how to extract as much knowledge as possible and store it in as little space as possible. It is the ability to receive new data and to store it using existing knowledge.

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How to compress a text the most?
* How can you discover information in a compressed source?
* Is it possible to devise a program that will generate the appropriate output based on a dictionary (key => value) in such a way that the program is smaller than the dictionary? Is this the same as writing compression of a file/dictionary?
* Everything can be considered as an index in a infinite dictionary of random digits and we are simply referring to specific points of that dictionary when we "create" functions such as trigonometric functions
* Compression can only occur if there is duplication in data
* Strategies for declaring a dictionary
	* Declare the range of valid characters
	* Declare a list of valid characters
