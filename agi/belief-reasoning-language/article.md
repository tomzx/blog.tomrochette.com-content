## Things to explore

# Overview

BELIEF_DECLARATION := BELIEF WHAT CERTAINTY%
BELIEF := TRUE|FALSE
WHAT := SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT
CERTAINTY := 0,1,2,...,100
PREDICATE := LIKE|DISLIKE(or only like with belief = false?)|THINK|
SUBJECT := I|X (where X is a person/entity)

It is likely that the OBJECT needs to be able to be recursive (I think that (X thinks (Y likes Z)))
