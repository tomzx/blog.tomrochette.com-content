## Context
Human beings like to anthropomorphize things. We like to give things human characteristics. We do this with animals, inanimate objects, and even inanimate objects that are not even alive. We do this with computers, too. We give them names, we talk to them, we treat them like they are people. We even give them human characteristics, like emotions and feelings.
