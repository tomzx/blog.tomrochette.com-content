What are some skills that an AGI based on ChatGPT would need to have?

* Prompt the operator to disambiguate
	* Ideally operator prompting should be minimal. ChatGPT should use its own discretion as much as possible.
	* However in certain circumstances there will be too many options to choose from, or some of the options will require a lot of work to complete and may need the input from the operator in order to proceed.
* Extract instructions/actions from text
	* ChatGPT can only interact with its environment through text. As such, the text instructions it generates need to be turned into computer programs that can be executed.
* Generate code
	* For the purpose of our studies we will try to limit ourselves to using the Python programming language as it should be versatile enough to complete a wide variety of tasks. Furthermore ChatGPT is likely to have been trained on a lot of Python code, so it should be able to generate fairly good Python code that does not require a lot of manual tweaking or iterations.
* Execute code
	* Once ChatGPT has generated python code, it needs to be able to execute it. As we do not want to have to worry about what the script does, we will need to run it in a sandboxed environment.
* Identify useful behavior that can be reused
* Recognize when we're in a prompt-response loop
	* A prompt-response loop is when we ask ChatGPT something, it responds, we ask it something else, it responds, but not progress is being made. We're stuck in a loop.
	* If we're in a prompt-response loop, we need to be able to break out of it.
	* At a high level, identifying that we're in a prompt-response loop is difficult. We could ask ChatGPT whether it thinks that the last few prompt-response are somewhat identical, and if so, we could ask it to prompt the operator for help.
	* Ideally we would want to avoid having to do prompt-response loop detection, possibly by tracking some form of plan and identifying when we're not making progress towards the next step. This could be done for example, by recording how many prompt-response cycles we've done for a given step of a plan and prompting ChatGPT for a status update.
* Recognize when the desired behavior/action has been completed
