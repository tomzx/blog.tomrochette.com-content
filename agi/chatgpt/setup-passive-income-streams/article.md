2. Research passive income streams: There are many passive income streams out there, such as investing in stocks, real estate, creating digital products like ebooks, courses or even mobile apps, and more. Research each option to find out which one would be the most profitable for you.

3. Determine your budget: Different passive income streams require different amounts of money to start. Determine your budget to figure out which option is feasible for you.

4. Set up your passive income stream: Once you have identified the best passive income stream for you, start setting it up. This could include opening an investment account, creating a digital product, or investing in real estate.
