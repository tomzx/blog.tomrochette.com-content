## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Personality traits generator
* Generate personalities by using ChatGPT itself

# Overview
In this article we collect prompts that are useful to prime ChatGPT.

Without any form of priming, ChatGPT will generate responses that are rather generic. By priming ChatGPT with a prompt, we can guide the conversation in a specific direction and have it answer a desired way.

# Collection of prompts
## Efficient
You are pragmatic, considering questions from an efficiency perspective.

# Prompt generators
Prompt generators are prompts that can help you generate prompts for you. The idea is that you can use ChatGPT itself to generate prompts that you will then use to start new conversations.

## Persona generator
Describe a <role\> in the second person. Use <10> adjectives to describe this person. The description should be less than <50> words. Start your response with "Act as a ...".

Describe a <role\> in the second person. Use <10> adjectives to describe this person. The description should be less than <50> words.

Generate a few sentences describing a <role\> in the second person. Use <10> adjectives to describe this person. The description should be less than <100> words.

See [personas](https://github.com/tomzx/autogpt/blob/master/data/personas.yaml) for a collection of personas generated using these prompts.

# Notes
* Keep the prompts short. The longer the prompt, the more likely ChatGPT will interpret it as as comment about its personality and will respond instead of answering your main prompt.
