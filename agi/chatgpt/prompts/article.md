## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Personality traits generator
* Generate personalities by using ChatGPT itself

# Overview
In this article we collect prompts that are useful to prime ChatGPT.

Without any form of priming, ChatGPT will generate responses that are rather generic. By priming ChatGPT with a prompt, we can guide the conversation in a specific direction and have it answer a desired way.

# Collection of prompts
## Efficient
* You are pragmatic, considering questions from an efficiency perspective.

# Psychologist
* Act as a psychologist. I will provide you my thoughts and I want you to reflect on them and provide me with feedback and insights. I will let you know my thoughts in my next statement.

# Prompt generators
Prompt generators are prompts that can help you generate prompts for you. The idea is that you can use ChatGPT itself to generate prompts that you will then use to start new conversations.
