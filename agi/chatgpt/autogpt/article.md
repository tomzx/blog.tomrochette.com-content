# Notes
* Like any project, before leaving AutoGPT to its own devices, it is important to set both a time and monetary budget. This is to prevent it from running indefinitely and to prevent it from running up a large bill.
* Like any project, as a project manager, it is important to have regular checks to ensure that the project is on track. Leaving AutoGPT unattended may result in ChatGPT being stuck in a prompt-response loop or having ChatGPT working on something completely unrelated.

# Task distribution
Given that ChatGPT will generally produce a list of tasks to produce in order to achieve a goal, it is possible to distribute those tasks to different agents. This is similar to how a project manager would distribute tasks to different people. This is also similar to how a machine learning engineer would distribute tasks to different machine learning models.

Given that current ChatGPT models take between 8 and 20 seconds to respond, high task parallelism will make better use of your rate limit.
