## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Notes
* Tree main ingredients:
	* Automatic
	* Scalable
	* Check many properties
* Any tool that can automatically check millions of lines of code against hundreds of coding rules is bound to find on average, say, one bug every thousand lines of code
* Given a program with a set of input parameters, automatically generate a set of input values that, upon execution, will exercise as many program statements as possible
* 3 tools developed at Microsoft using techniques from
	* Static program analysis (symbolic execution)
	* Dynamic analysis (testing and runtime instrumentation)
	* Model checking (systematic state-space exploration)
	* Automated constraint solving

## Static versus dynamic test generation
* Static test generation consists of analyzing a program P statically by reading the program code and using symbolic execution techniques to simulate abstract program executions to attempt to compute inputs to drive P along specific execution paths or branches, without ever executing the program
* Cannot reason about constraints outside of the constraint solver's scope of reasoning (external method calls, calls to functions such as hash functions which are mathematically designed to prevent such reasoning)
* Dynamic test generation, consists of
	* executing the program P, starting with some given or random inputs
	* gathering symbolic constraints on inputs at conditional statements along the execution
	* using a constraint solver to infer variants of the previous input to steer the program's next execution toward an alternative program branch
* This process is repeated until a specific program statement is reached

<pre><code class="language-cpp line-numbers">
int obscure(int x, int y) {
	if (x == hash(y)) {
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}
</code></pre>

* To solve the x == hash(y) problem, we can execute hash(y) with a given value and then assign x to this value

## SAGE: White-box fuzz testing for security
### SAGE architecture
* SAGE repeatedly performs four main tasks.
	* The tester executes the test program on a given input under a runtime checker looking for various kinds of runtime exceptions, such as hangs and memory access violation
	* The coverage collector collects instruction adresses executed during the run; instruction coverage is used as a heuristic to favor the expansion of executions with high new coverage
	* The tracer records a complete instruction-level trace of the run using the iDNA framework
	* Lastly, the symbolic executor replays the recorded execution, collects input-related constraints, and generates new inputs using the constraint solver Disolver

## Pex: Automating unit testing for .NET
* Most fully automatic test-generation tools suffer from a common problem: they don't know when a test fails
* A new testing methodology: the parameterized unit test (PUT)
* Pex uses Z3 as its constraint solver

## Yogi: Combining testing and static analysis
* The Yogi tool verifies properties specified by finite-state machines representing invalid program behaviors
