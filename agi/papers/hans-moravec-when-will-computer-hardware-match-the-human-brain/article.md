## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Notes
## Brains, Eyes and Machines
* The retina seems to process about ten one-million-point images per second
* It takes robot vision programs about 100 computer instructions to derive single edge or motion detections from comparable video images. 100 million instructions are needed to do a million detections, at 1,000 MIPS to repeat them ten times per second to match the retina
* The 1,500 cubic centimeter human brain is about 100,000 times as large as the retina, suggesting that matching overall human behavior will take about 100 million MIPS of computer power
* Decoupling training from use will allow robots to do more with less
* One day we may find that plants remember much, but process it slowly
