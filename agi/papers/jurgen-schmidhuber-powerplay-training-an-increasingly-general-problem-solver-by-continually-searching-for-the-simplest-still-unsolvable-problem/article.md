# Overview

# Notes
## 1. Introduction
* Given a realistic piece of computational hardware with specific resource limitations, how can one devise software for it that will solve all, or at least many, of the a priori unknown tasks that are in principle easily solvable on this architecture?
	* How to build a practical general problem solver, given the computational restrictions?
* How do initially helpless human babies become rather general problem solvers over time? Apparently by playing
	* Infants continually seem to invent new tasks that become boring as soon as their solutions become known
