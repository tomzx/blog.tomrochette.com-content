# Notes
## 1. Introduction
* Given a realistic piece of computational hardware with specific resource limitations, how can one devise software for it that will solve all, or at least many, of the a priori unknown tasks that are in principle easily solvable on this architecture?
	* How to build a practical general problem solver, given the computational restrictions?
* How do initially helpless human babies become rather general problem solvers over time? Apparently by playing
	* Infants continually seem to invent new tasks that become boring as soon as their solutions become known
	* Easy-to-learn new tasks are preferred over unsolvable or hard-to-learn tasks

### 1.1. Basic Ideas
* In traditional computer science, given some formally defined task, a search algorithm is used to search a space of solution candidates until a solution to the task is found and verified
* To automatically construct an increasingly general problem solver, let us expand the traditional search space in an unsual way, such that it includes all possible pairs of computable tasks with possibly computable solutions, and problem solvers
	* Given an old problem solver that can already solve a finite known set of previously learned tasks, a search algorithm is used to find a new pair that provably has the following properties:
		* the new task cannot be solved by the old problem solver
		* The new task can be solved by the new problem solver (some modification of the old one)
		* The new solver can still solve the known set of previously learned tasks
* Smart search orders candidate pairs of the type (task, solver) by computational complexity, using concepts of optimal universal search
