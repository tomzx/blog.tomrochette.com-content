# Overview

# Notes
## 1 Introduction
* To become a general problem solver that is able to run arbitrary problem-solving programs, the controller of a robot or artificial agent must be a general-purpose computer
* Without a teacher, reward-maximizing programs of an RNN must be learned through repeated trial and error, e.g., through artificial evolution or reinforcement learning through policy gradients
* The search space can often be reduced dramatically by evolving compact encodings of RNNs
