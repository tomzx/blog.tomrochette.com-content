## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Given a single neural network architecture, it might be possible to store different weight values that would represent different views of the environment (this would be akin to a person's consciousness?)

# Overview

# Notes
## 1 Introduction
* To become a general problem solver that is able to run arbitrary problem-solving programs, the controller of a robot or artificial agent must be a general-purpose computer
* Without a teacher, reward-maximizing programs of an RNN must be learned through repeated trial and error, e.g., through artificial evolution or reinforcement learning through policy gradients
* The search space can often be reduced dramatically by evolving compact encodings of RNNs

## 2 One Big RNN For Everything: Basic Ideas and Related Work
* ONE or copies thereof or parts thereof are trained in various ways, in particular
	* by black box optimization/reinforcement learning/artificial evolution without a teacher
	* gradient descent-based supervised or unsupervised learning

## 3 More Formally: ONE and its Self-Acquired Data
* Cumulative reward $CR(t) = \sum_{\tau=1}^t R(\tau)$
