# Overview

# 4.3 Planning Game (PG)
* Customer stories are written on cards
* Cards are put into 3 piles
	* Those without which the system will not function
	* Those that are less essential but provide significant business value
	* Those that would be nice to have
* The programmer estimates how long each requirement would take to implement and then begin to sort the requirements into 3 piles (i.e. sort by risk)
	* Those that can be estimated precisely
	* Those that can be estimated reasonably well
	* Those that cannot be estimated at all
* Requirements are not compared against each other but again which "bucket" they are in, thus it takes $n$ time to prioritize $n$ requirements

# 4.4 100 Points method
* Each person gets a certain amount of points to "purchase ideas"
* The requirement that has got the highest score (amount of points given by the participants) is the most important requirement
* This method only works once in every project (as participants learn what others will value)
* It takes $n$ time to prioritize $n$ requirements, but because a ratio scale is used, it takes more time per decision than PG
