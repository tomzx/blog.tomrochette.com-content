## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Using EP theory, how does one program "mutate" into another?

# Overview
* Adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine are the four basic building blocks of programs (binary blocks)
* Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) = small helper functions
* Abstraction: encapsulating a small program within a function, provided the function accepts an argument
* During large scale program evolution, abstraction is essential for at least the following two reasons:
	1. The user of an automatic programming system should not be required to define all needed help functions. Instead, the user should define a small number of primitives whereas the system automatically constructs a possibly large number of help functions.
	2. The system can construct a help function exactly where it is needed and avoid having a too large scope for the function.
* A form of scope restriction actually seems to exist in DNA since repeats often occur in localized regions
	* For example, the clustering of multiple copies of genes encoding ribosomal RNA in humans
* ADATE uses a so-called cost limit $l$ that says how many children programs are to be produced from a given parent program. An abstraction is assigned a cost $c$ which indicates that $l/c$ programs are to be based on the abstraction
* Discriminate against bodies containing if-tests that do not depend on any parameter
