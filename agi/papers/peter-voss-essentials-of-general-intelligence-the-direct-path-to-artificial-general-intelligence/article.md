# Overview

## 2 General Intelligence
* Intelligence can be defined simply as an entity's ability to achieve goals - with greater intelligence coping with more complex and novel situations
* General intelligence comprises the essential, domain-independent skills necessary for acquiring a wide range of domain-specific knowledge
* Learning must be autonomous, goal-directed and adaptive
* The mark of a generally intelligent system is not having a lot of knowledge and skills, but being able to acquire and improve them and to be able to appropriately apply them
* An AGI system should be able to learn to recognize and categorize a wide range of novel perceptual patterns
* It should be able to autonomously learn appropriate, goal-directed responses to input contexts (given some feedback mechanism)

## 2.1 Core Requirements for General Intelligence
* Perceived entities/patterns must be stored in a way that facilitates concept formation and generalization
* An effective way to represent complex feature relationships is through vector encoding
* Any practical applications of AGI must inherently be able to process temporal data as patterns in time - not just as static patterns with a time dimension
* AGIs must cope with data from different sense probes and deal with attributes such as: noisy, scalar, unreliable, incomplete, multi-dimensional, etc.
* Another essential requirement of general intelligence is to cope with an overabundance of data
* The system needs to have some control over what input data is selected for analysis and learning - both in terms of which data, and also the degree of detail
* Senses are needed not only for selection and focus, but in order to ground concepts in reality

## 3 Shortcuts to AGI
* In addition to understanding general intelligence, AGI design also requires an appreciation of the differences between artificial (synthetic) and biological intelligence, and between designed and evolved systems
* Work focused on
	* General rather than domain-specific cognitive ability
	* Acquired knowledge and skills, vesus loaded databases and coded skills
	* Bi-directional, real-time interaction, versus batch processing
	* Adaptive attention (focus and selection), vesus human pre-selected data
	* Core support for dynamic patterns, versus static data
	* Unsupervised and self-supervised, versus supervised learning
	* Adaptive, self-organizing data structures, versus fixed neural nets or databases
	* Contextual, grounded concepts, versus hard-coded, symbolic concepts
	* Explicitly engineering functionality, versus evolving it
	* Conceptual design, versus reverse-engineering
	* General proof-of-concept, versus specific real applications development
	* Animal level cognition, versus abstract thought, language, and formal logic
* Self-improvement takes two distinct forms/phases:
	* Coding the basic skills that allow the system to acquire a large amount of specific knowledge
	* The system reaching sufficient intelligence and conceptual understanding of its own design, to enable it to deliberately improve its own design
* Many AI systems do all of their learning in batch mode and have little or no ability to learn incrementally
* In many cases they are unable to adapt beyond the initial training set without reprogramming or retraining
* Intelligent systems must be able to act
	* Acting on the "world" - be it to communicate, to navigate or explore, or to manipulate some external function or device in order to achieve goals
	* Controlling or modifying the system's internal parameters (such as learning rate or noise tolerance, etc.) in order to set or improve functionality
	* Controlling the system's sense input parameters such as focus, selection, resolution (granularity) as well as adjusting feature extraction parameters
* AGI systems must inherently be designed to acquire knowledge by themselves
* They need to control what input data is processed, where specifically to obtain data, in how much detail, and in what format
* All acquired knowledge and skills is encoded in one integrated network-like structure
* One can say that "high-level intelligence is conceptual intelligence"
* Autonomous concept formation is one of the key tests of intelligence
* Design to achieve the desired functionality of the brain rather than try to replicate evolution's design
* Here is a list of desirable cognitive features that can be included in an AGI design that would not exist in a reverse-engineered brain:
	* More effective control of neurochemistry (emotional states)
	* Selecting the appropriate degree of logical thinking versus intuition
	* More effective control over focus and attention
	* Being able to learn instantly, on demand
	* Direct and rapid interfacing with databases, the Internet and other machines - potentially having instant access to all available knowledge
	* Optional "photographic" memory and recall on all senses
	* Better control over remembering and forgetting (freezing important knowledge, and being able to unlearn)
	* The ability to accurately backtrack and review thought and decision processes (retrace and explore logic pathways)
	* Patterns, nodes and links can easily be tagged (labeled) and categorized
	* The ability to optimize the design for the available hardware instead of being forced to conform to the brain's requirements
	* The ability to utilize the best existing algorithms and software techniques - irrespective of whether they are biologically plausible
	* Custom designed AGI can have a simple speed/capacity upgrade path
	* The possibility of comprehensive integration with other AI systems (like expert systems, robotics, specialized sense pre-processors, and problem solvers)
	* The ability to construct AGIs that are highly optimized for specific domains
	* Node, link, and internal parameter data is available as "input data" (full introspection)
	* Design specifications are available (to the designer and to the AGI itself!)
	* Seed AI design: A machine can inherently be designed to more easily understand and improve its own functioning - thus bootstrapping intelligence to ever higher levels
* Discoveries in cognitive psychology point towards generalized pattern processing being the foundational mechanism for all higher level functioning

## 4 Foundational Cognitive Capabilities
* General intelligence requires a number of foundational cognitive abilities:
	* Remember and recognize patterns representing coherent features of reality
	* Relate such patterns by various similarities, differences, and associations
	* Learn and perform a variety of actions
	* Evaluate and encode feedback from a goal system
	* Autonomously adjust its system control parameters
* Pattern acquisition through lazy learning
	* Stored feature patterns with adaptive fuzzy tolerances
	* Recognition/Pattern matching through a competitive winner-take-all, as a set or aggregate of similar patterns, or by forced choice
* The matching algorithm is able to recall patterns by any dimension

## 5 An AGI in the Making
1. Development framework
2. Memory core and interface structure
3. Individual foundational cognitive components
4. Integrated low-level cognition
5. Increased level of functionality

* AGI engine with the following basic components:
	* A set of pluggable, programmable (virtual) sensors and actuators (called probes)
	* A central pattern store/engine including all data and cognitive algorithms
	* A configurable, dynamic 2D virtual world, plus various training and diagnostic tools
* Additional details:
	* Data recorder with playback
	* Data visualization and editing tools
	* A cognitive core with many foundational cognitive algorithms
	* An interface manager which communicates with the probes, the cognitive core and the data recorder

## 5.1 AGI Engine Architecture and Design Features
* Can be separated into three parts:
	* Cognitive core
	* Control/Interface logic
	* Input/Output probes
* Cognitive core
	* Central repository of all static and dynamic data patterns - including all learned cognitive and behavioral states, associations, and sequences
	* All data is stored in a single, integrated node-link structure
* Control and interface logic
	* Coordinates the network's execution cycle, drives various cognitive and housekeeping algorithms, and controls/adapts system parameters
	* Via an interface manager, communicates data and control information to and from the probes
* Probes
	* Programmable feature extractors, variable data resolution, focus and selection mechanisms
* Development environment, language, and hardware
* Implemented in C#/.NET
* Practical/Proof-of-concept prototype performance can be achieved on a single PC (2 GHz, 512 MiB)

## 6 From Algorithms to General Intelligence
* General intelligence emerges from the synergetic integration of a number of essential fundamental components

## 7 Other Research
* Classifies their work in the area of agent systems and embodied cognitive science

## 8 Fast-track AGI: Why So Rare?
* Some technical issues worth mentioning:
	* Epistemology: Theory of knowledge, the nature of knowledge, and how it relates to reality.
	* Theory of mind: The formulation and understanding of consciousness, intelligence, volition, meaning, emotions, common sense, qualia.
	* Cognitive psychology: Proper understanding of the concept intelligence.
	* Project focus: A vision of how to get from here to there.
	* Research support
		* Incremental, real-time, unsupervsed/self-supervised learning
		* Integrated support for temporal patterns
		* Dynamically-adaptive neural network topologies
		* Self-tuning of system parameters, integrating bottom-up (data driven) and top-down (goal/meta-cognition driven) auto-adaptation
		* Sense probes with auto-adaptive feature extractors
	* Cost and difficulty: Finding the crucial fundamental functionality. Scaling up the system to human-level storage and processing capacity
