When discussing a topic, it is always important to define the vocabulary we're using so that a common shared definition is used.

When it comes to AGI, this definition is not yet 100% clear.

Here I share my own definition. I will try to explore alternative properties as this article evolves.

## Properties
### General AGI
* Is able to learn (behavior, facts) from input
* Is able to retrieve (behavior, facts) from memory
* Is able to regenerate (behavior, facts) as output
* Is able to generate predictions
* Can interact with an environment (either virtual or real)
* Does not need to know everything

# Humanoid AGI
* Is able (after some amount of learning) to accomplish some humanoid behavior
	* We expect an AGI to be able to reproduce human behaviors,
* Can interact with human beings at an appropriate speed
	* Interacting too slowly would make it appear dumb/non-human
* Can interact with the physical environment

# Wikipedia's definition
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.
