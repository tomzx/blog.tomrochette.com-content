## Learned in this study

* Emergence of understanding/learning by observing many instances of a symbol to extract it
* An AGI must be able to efficiently separate constant from variable in the examples it is given
* In order to reduce the problem of dimensionality, it must be able to focus its scope/attention

## Things to explore

* Parallel between a program's evolution an a human evolution

# Progression/Evolution of the agent - environment interactions

## Zygote

Life begins with the fertilization of of a human egg by sperm. The zygote then goes through mitosis, rapidly increasing the number of cells while remaining the same size as the original zygote. After various phases, the zygote has turned into an embryo. After a couple of weeks (~8 weeks[^1]) the embryo is instead called a fetus.

## Embryo/Fetus

At some point during that process, the embryo/fetus begins to process information. The exact moment this process begins is most likely very interesting and similar in fashion to abiogenesis. One could certainly argue that at every point in time information is processed so it never actually starts/stops. However, if we consider the brain as the main unit of information processing, we can consider that by the time the corpus callosum has appeared[^2], the brain may have started processing information.

Information processing is most likely a process that gradually increases.

In the beginning it might appear as a single light flickering in the dark, switching from its on/off state. As more and more units develop, the flickering keeps occurring but in bigger and bigger volumes. As a single unit, the embryo/fetus is dependent on its mother to provide it with energy. This probably also means that from that moment forward, the brain would attempt to use the least energy it needs to spend.

# Understanding concepts/symbols

Understanding comes from the observation of a sequence of inputs. Those inputs are then correlated to one another such that if you (...TBC...)

To understand a color, for instance *red*, you need to associate various observations with the symbol inside your head. Red cars, red books, red stop signs, red blocks, etc. After a while the concept emerges from all the different observations. In the same way that a child gets asked by its parent "what color is this?" while pointing at various objects, the child learns both to recognize specific colors as well as understand that colors is an abstract concept that contains many instances.

Thus, a system that wants to rapidly learn must be able to quickly identify what remains constant from what changes.

Each and every person has its own signature. However, it is not uncommon for many people to share a similar signature (have their *aura* sensed as a single identity).
