## Things to explore

# Overview
**Add-one smoothing** Assign a count of 1 to unseen n-grams
**BLAS** Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
**Epsilon-greedy strategy/policy** An action in a set of actions A is selected at random with probability $\epsilon$  while we may pick the action that gives the maximum amount of reward with probability $1 - \epsilon$
**Fingerprinting** Converting a large space into a small space for faster comparison
**One-hot vector** A vector which is 0 in most dimension and 1 in a single dimension. Ex: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
**Skip-grams** Generalization of n-grams in which the components (typically words) need not be consecutive in the text under consideration, but may leave gaps that are skipped over
**Syntactic n-grams** n-grams defined by paths in syntactic dependency or constituent trees rather than the linear structure of the text.
