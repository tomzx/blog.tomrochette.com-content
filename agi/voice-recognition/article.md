## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* MFC/MFCC
* Recognize speakers using per speaker models
	* Start with a single model for all speakers, and slowly figure out when a given speaker speaks, then retrain their individual model to become more and more accurate

## To try
* Determine vocal tract size

# Overview
The goal of this project is to recognize a person based on a record of his/her voice.

* Record audio
* Convert a certain window size (e.g., 20ms long) of the signal into the frequency domain using a fast Fourier transform

# From the Deep Learning Book
* Factors of variation
	* Age
	* Sex
	* Accent
	* Words spoken

# From the Bay Area Deep Learning School
* Application matters
	* Styles of speech
		* Read
		* Conversational
		* Spontaneous
		* Command/control
	* Issues
		* Disfluency/Stuttering
		* Noise
		* Microphone quality/Number of channels
		* Far field
		* Reverb/Echo
		* Lombard effect
		* Speaker accents

# From PHO121 - Speech Analysis
* Vowels can be classified by their two first formants (F1 and F2)
	* Resonant frequencies that can roughly be associated with the size of specific cavities in the vocal tract
	* F1: Pharyngeal cavity
	* F2: Front cavity
