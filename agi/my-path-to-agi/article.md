# Preface

If you are interested in a more digestible path through the same content I've experienced, I suggest you look up [my suggested path to AGI](../my-suggested-path-to-agi) article. It basically contains most of the stuff I've gone through myself, but it is organized in a constructive manner to a new comer (at least, in my opinion).

If you have comments and suggestions, feel free to let me know through the comments!
