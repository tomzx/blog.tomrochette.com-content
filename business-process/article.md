# Overview
The following is a list of things I do at regular intervals regarding my business in the hopes of improving how well it works.

# Lifetime
* Plan how the business will be when it is "finished", then backtrack to the present and plan how youâ€™ll get there
* Define the business you want and then start implementing it from day one

# Yearly
* Reflect on the year that completed and determine what you want to get rid of and what you want improve
* Plan the high level goals for the year to come

# Monthly
* Find what the 80/20 of the business is at the moment and plan the month with that in mind
* Track the progress of the overall goals
* Review/Update the business process
* Figure out where time is wasted and work to get rid of that time
* Try to automate as much as possible / Look for things that are worth optimizing
* Find things you can innovate on (things that are mundane but could be changed in order to improve something)

# Weekly
* Do a problem/root cause analysis on any issue that is occurring enough to be a problem

# Daily
* Quantify everything you can, then track/measure it (with proper statistical analysis)
* Evaluate different changes and their impact
* Figure out what is **The Best Way** to do everything
* Note everything that is a problem (so that you can fix it while doing a monthly review)
* Test ideas
* Work on making the process/results predictable (by the customers)
