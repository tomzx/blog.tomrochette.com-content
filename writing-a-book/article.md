## Context
I've been writing a lot about different things on this blog/website. I thought it would be appropriate for me to attempt to write a book, something that would be a little bit more constructive than simply writing what was going on in my head. Thus the goal of writing a book was born.

I'm always curious about the processes involved in accomplishing a certain goal. In this case, how should one write a book?
