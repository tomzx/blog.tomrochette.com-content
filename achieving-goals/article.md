* It's important to know what your goals are.
* It's important to understand why they are your goals.
* It's important to determine which goals are more important than others (goals priority).
* It's important to know which goals are dependent on other goals (goals decomposition and dependency).
* To reach a goal, you must first acquire the tools (knowledge, resources) to get to your objective.
* It's important to know when to drop/abandon goals.

* Sources of inefficiency
	* Trying to do the same time repeatedly while not having enough experience to do it.

* Always try to figure out the most optimal path toward a goal
	* Observe others successful at achieving the goal you want to achieve.
	* Determine the differences between your state and theirs (what they know, what resources are available to them, etc.).

* How to determine when it is not possible to reach a goal at a given moment in time?
	* Not enough time available
	* Too costly
	* Dependencies not resolved/ready
