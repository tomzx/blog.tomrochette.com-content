# Problem
I want to analyze a python script to extract something from it. How do I do that?

# Solution
Python has an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) like most programming language.

You can use the [ast module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) with the [parser module]()
