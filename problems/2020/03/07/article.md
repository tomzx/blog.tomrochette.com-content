# Problem
My [click CLI](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) is slow, even just to show the help. How do I make it go faster?

# Solution
In most cases, the reason your click CLI is slow is that you have large imports at the top of the files where you have declared your commands.

The typical pattern is as follows:

cli.py
```python
from train import train
from predict import predict

@click.group()
def cli():
	pass

cli.add_command(predict)
cli.add_command(train)
```

train.py
```python
import click
import pandas as pd
import torch

@click.command()
def train():
	pass
```

predict.py
```python
import click
import pandas as pd
import torch

@click.command()
def predict():
	pass
```

Notice that in both these files we import `pandas` and `torch`, which can account for a large chunk of script execution time simply due to importing them. You can verify that by simply running `python -X importtime train.py 2>tuna.log` and using [tuna](https://github.com/nschloe/tuna) (run `tuna tuna.log`) to inspect the results and convince yourself.

The suggested pattern is to move the imports inside of the function itself, as such:

train.py
```python
import click

@click.command()
def train():
	import pandas as pd
	import torch

	pass
```

predict.py
```python
import click

@click.command()
def predict():
	import pandas as pd
	import torch

	pass
```

This will shave off a large amount of time spent importing those packages (`pandas` and `torch`). They will only be loaded when you need to run the command itself, not every time you invoke the CLI.
