# Problem
I have rated a lot of movies on Rotten Tomatoes and I'd like to export them to a text format. I also know PHP. How can I do that?

# Solution
In 2013 I wrote [Rotten Tomatoes ratings exporter](https://github.com/tomzx/rotten-tomatoes-exporter) for the purpose of exporting the movies I had rated into a format I could read and also store.
