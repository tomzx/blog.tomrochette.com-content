# Problem
I write a lot of articles and I want them to be understood by the most people. How do I use the most common language possible?

# Solution
My approach is to write whatever I want to write about using whatever language I come up with first. Then I use a tool I've developed which I've called the [vocabulary gradient](https://github.com/tomzx/vocabulary-gradient). It is a very simple tool where you will generally copy and paste the article you've written and look at the result of the analysis. The tool uses a word frequency list as specified in the README.md. This list was built using the Project Gutenberg library, which makes the word frequency list a bit outdated.

The report generated by the tool presents the minimum, average, maximum and standard deviation of the index of the words used in the text you provided. An histogram is also generated
