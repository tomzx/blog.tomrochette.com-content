# Problem
I write a lot of articles and I want them to be understood by the most people. How do I use the most common language possible?

# Solution
My approach is to write whatever I want to write about using whatever language I come up with first. Then I use a tool I've developed which I've called the [vocabulary gradient](https://github.com/tomzx/vocabulary-gradient).
