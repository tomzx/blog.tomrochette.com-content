# Problem
I use [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for my PHP libraries and I'd like to know when I generate breaking changes to my code. I would like to have a tool that tells me when that happens, as soon as possible so I can avoid creating backward-incompatible changes.

# Solution
