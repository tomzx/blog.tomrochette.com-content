* Do not do day trading in your TFSA/RRSP/RESP accounts
* Your gains/losses will either be categorized as capital gains (50% taxable) or business income (100% taxable) based on how you trade. In any case, since this is a day trading article, you can assume this will be business income. Here are some properties taken into account
	* Volume and frequency of trading
	* Length of ownership of securities
	* Type of securities owned
	* Your profession and level of stock market knowledge
	* If trading is your main source of income or substantially supplements it
