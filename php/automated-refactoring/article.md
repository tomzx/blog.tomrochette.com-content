## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Component extraction (find all dependencies and attempt to create a self-contained library)
* Convert function-based code into class-based code (static calls)
	* Copy all functions in a file into a new class where each function is static
	* Find all calls to the initial functions and replace them with calls to the class
	* Verify that all entry points load the autoloader (how to check that? search for the autoload.php string and require/include calls?)
* Template/logic separation
* Extraction of functions into a separate file
* Extraction and replacement of inline style
* Extraction of string resources
* Extraction of inline JS
* Extraction of inline CSS
* Conversion of raw view logic to template logic
* Removal of inline PHP code in js code
* Convert raw SQL into builder queries
* Move queries in controller into a service/repository
* Convert <? to <?php
* Convert echo calls to string concat + return
* Update outdated phpdoc
* Improve typing (parameters and return)

# Difficulties of code refactoring
* Lot of code is SQL queries

# Refactoring to MVC
