## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview
* Encapsulate the application within a .phar
* Use obfuscation (can only obfuscate variables inside function/methods as anything else must remain with the same name in order to allow for dynamically called methods (or simply do not support such code))

# Requirements
* Must not make it easy to extract the original source code
* Must checksum itself for modification
* Should prevent usage by sharing a single license (TBD?)
* Should not be possible to reuse a trial forever in a VM

# Issues
* Relying on opcode (to act as a binary) probably implies you are dependent on the php version used. Furthermore, it also means that the extension must be available and enabled for the code to work
* Given the current implementation of op*cache*, the cache cannot be reused on other machines as it contains the system ID as part of an opcache file header

# PHP OPCache
## Header
* OPCACHE
* System ID
* Timestamp

* Checksum

-> zend_accel_load_script (persistent_script, from_memory)

# Obfuscation
* Replace classes methods with (generated) traits that contain one or many of the classes method
* Compression/optimization by creating variables

## Issues
* Even with obfuscation, PSR0/4 based code is too easy to distinguish (no reason to obfuscate libraries)

## Ideas
* Find some way to transform the original source such that it is in symbiosis with a client identifier (and thus cannot be removed)
	* See [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function)

# Packaging
* Replace variables within functions with obfuscated names
* Concatenate all files into a single file (or bundle of files)
	* Pre-process require/include, or do not allow their use (as the files will not be available)
* Randomize file order
* Scramble method order
* Inject junk code
	* Insert junk code with encrypted user identification
* Generate a differently scrambled version per download/user
