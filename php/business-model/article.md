## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

## Cartalyst
* https://cartalyst.com/
* 75$/3 months
* 25$/month
* Subscription-based model

# Models
## Subscription based
* Some development must be done in order to protect the software against forbidden use (no subscription)
* May require a "call-to-home" (Internet connection) to verify the subscription is still valid
	* Might be easily countered by firewalling the application
		* We may allow it to go unchecked for 1-X days until we tell the user to connect, but that is bad user experience

### Examples
* https://www.ripstech.com/pricing/

## On demand
* Similar to subscription based, but on a per use basis

### Examples
* https://www.ripstech.com/pricing/

## Open source
* Code is freely available
	* Makes it more difficult to live on producing the software

### Support based
* ($X*0.2)/user/year in support fees
* Fee per request

## Traditional - Major version and upgrades
* X$/user (one time fee)
* ($X*0.2)/user/year in support fees

## Software as a service
* Tools are never shared with the outside world

## Consultancy
* Develop tools to use on a per-project basis, where clients spent 5k$+ on a single pass
* Tools are never shared with the outside world
