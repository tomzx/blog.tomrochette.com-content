# Steps
* Build a list of task/items
List everything that you want to get out of your head. The goal here is to make explicit as much as possible.
* Deconstruct tasks into their pre-requisites and follow-up tasks
There are a couple of important things to consider when one wants to prioritize their task list. One is that even if a task is at the top of the list, it might not be possible to do it until its dependencies are fulfilled. This in turn means that all dependencies will have a superior priority to this task automatically.
However, it frequently happens that what we consider dependencies can in fact be delayed or temporarily replaced by another solution which takes less time to implement or costs less (or for whatever other reason can replace the original dependency).
* Split tasks into 2 groups (and repeat this process)
The idea here is to quickly filter out as many tasks as possible. As you may have noticed, I have not specified the filtering predicate. It is up to you to filter out your tasks such that you will have the least amount to filter at once. Examples of predicates you could use are "will/will not do", "want/do not want", "need/do not need", "like/do not like" and so on.
* Prioritize the tasks that will have to be done
After a certain number of iterations of the previous step, you should arrive at a point where the items you have all need to be done, but you do not know in which order you have to do them (or want to do them).

## 4 Quadrants Method
This method, also known as the Eisenhower Matrix, involves categorizing tasks into four groups: Urgent/Important, Not Urgent/Important, Urgent/Not Important, and Not Urgent/Not Important. By sorting tasks this way, you can focus on what truly matters and avoid spending time on less critical activities.

## Analytic Hierarchy Process
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. It involves breaking down a problem into its components, comparing them pairwise, and assigning weights to determine the relative priority of each task.

## Binary Search Tree
Using a binary search tree for prioritization means inserting tasks based on their priority value, allowing for efficient retrieval and reordering. This approach is useful for dynamically managing and updating a list of tasks as priorities change.

## Planning Game
The Planning Game is a collaborative method often used in agile development, where stakeholders and team members estimate and prioritize tasks together. It encourages discussion, negotiation, and consensus to determine which tasks should be tackled first.

## 100-Point Method
In the 100-Point Method, each participant is given 100 points to distribute among a list of tasks or requirements according to their perceived importance. The tasks with the highest total points are prioritized, reflecting the collective preferences of the group.
