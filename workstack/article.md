The workstack is a very simple idea I had while working. It is based on the concept of a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) as the name clearly implies. As you work, you, like a computer, process things one at a time and as new things need to be done, you either throw them in a todo list (a queue), or you start doing them right away (you stack them).
