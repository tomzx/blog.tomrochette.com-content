> A man is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes he is lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts: "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
> 
> The man below says: "Yes you're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field."
> 
> "You must be a software developer," says the balloonist.
> 
> "I am," replies the man. "How did you know?"
> 
> "Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but it's of no use to anyone."
> 
> The man below says, "You must work in business as a manager." "I do," replies the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
> 
> "Well," says the man, "you don't know where you are or where you are going, but you expect me to be able to help. You're in the same position you were before we met but now it's my fault."
