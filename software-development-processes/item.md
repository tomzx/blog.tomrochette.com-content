# Risk management
* identify, characterize threats
* assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats
* determine the risk (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)
* identify ways to reduce those risks
* prioritize risk reduction measures
